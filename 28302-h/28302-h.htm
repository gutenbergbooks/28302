<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE MEETING OF BOSEPHUS AND HORATIO</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="music/bear1.mid"><img src="images/music1.png" width="400" height="68" alt="Music 1st Line" title="Music 1st Line" /></a>
</div>

<div class='poem2'>
"Oh, 'twas down in the woods of the Arkansaw,<br />
And the night was cloudy and the wind was raw,<br />
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="music/bear2.mid"><img src="images/music2.png" width="400" height="77" alt="Music 2nd Line" title="Music 2nd line" /></a>
</div>

<div class='poem2'>
And he didn't have a bed and he didn't have a bite,<br />
And if he hadn't fiddled he'd a travelled all night."<br /><br />
</div>


<div class='cap'>BOSEPHUS paused in his mad flight to listen. Surely
this was someone playing the violin, and the tune was
familiar.</div>

<p>He listened more intently.</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"But he came to a cabin and an old gray man,<br />
And says he, 'Where am I going? Now tell me if you can&mdash;&mdash;'"<br />
</div>

<p>It was the "Arkansaw Traveller" and close at hand. The
little boy tore hastily through the brush in the direction of the
music. The moon had come up, and he could see quite well,
but he did not pause to pick his way. As he stepped from the
thicket out into an open space the fiddling ceased. It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
bright moonlight there, too, and as Bosephus took in the situation
his blood turned cold.</p>

<p>In the center of the open space was a large tree. Backed
up against this tree, and looking straight at the little boy, with
fiddle in position for playing, and uplifted bow, was a huge
Black Bear!</p>

<p>Bosephus looked at the Bear, and the Bear looked at
Bosephus.</p>

<p>"Who are you, and what are you doing here?" he roared.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I am Bo-se-Bosephus, an' I&mdash;I g-guess I'm l-lost!"
gasped the little boy.</p>

<p>"Guess you are!" laughed the Bear, as he drew the bow
across the strings.</p>

<p>"An-an' I haven't had any s-supper, either."</p>

<p>"Neither have I!" grinned the Bear, "that is, none worth
mentioning. A young rabbit or two, perhaps, and a quart or so
of blackberries, but nothing real good and strengthening to
fill up on." Then he regarded Bosephus reflectively, and began
singing as he played softly:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"Oh, we'll have a little music first and then some supper, too,<br />
But before we have the supper we will play the music through."<br />
</div>

<p>"No hurry, you know. Be cool, please, and don't wiggle
so."</p>

<p>But Bosephus, or Bo, as he was called, was very much disturbed.
So far as he could see there was no prospect of supper
for anybody but the Bear.</p>

<p>"You'll forget all about supper pretty soon," continued the
Bear, fiddling.</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"You'll forget about your supper&mdash;you'll forget about your home&mdash;<br />
You'll forget you ever started out in Arkansaw to roam."<br />
</div>

<p>"My name is Horatio," he continued. "Called Ratio for
short. But I don't like it. Call me Horatio, in full, please."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i005.jpg" width="500" height="342" alt="&quot;MAYBE YOU CAN PLAY IT YOURSELF.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;MAYBE YOU CAN PLAY IT YOURSELF.&quot;</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, ye-yes, sir!" said Bo, hastily.</p>

<p>"See that you don't forget it!" grunted the Bear. "I don't
like familiarity in my guests. But I am clear away from the
song I was singing when you came tearing out of that thicket.
Seems like I never saw anybody in such a hurry to see me as you
were.</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"Now the old man sat a-fiddling by the little cabin door,<br />
And the tune was pretty lively, and he played it o'er and o'er;<br />
And the stranger sat a-list'ning and a-wond'ring what to do,<br />
As he fiddled and he fiddled, but he never played it through."<br />
</div>

<p>Bo was very fond of music, and as Horatio drew from the
strings the mellow strains of "The Arkansaw Traveller" he forgot
that both he and the Bear were hungry. He could dance
very well, and was just about to do so as the Bear paused.</p>

<p>"Why don't you play the rest of that tune, Horatio?" he
asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Same reason the old man didn't!" growled the Bear, still
humming the air,</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"Oh, raddy daddy dum&mdash;daddy dum&mdash;dum&mdash;dum&mdash;<br />
</div>

<p>"Why!" continued Bo, "that's funny!"</p>

<p>"Is it?" snorted Horatio; "I never thought so!</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"Then the stranger asked the fiddler 'Won't you play the rest for me?'<br />
'Don't know it,' says the fiddler, 'Play it for yourself!' says he&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
</div>

<p>"Maybe you can do what the stranger did, Bosephus&mdash;maybe you
can play it yourself, eh?" grunted the huge animal, pausing and
glowering at the little boy.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;that is, sir, I can only wh-whistle or
s-sing it!" trembled Bo.</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"Y-yes, sir. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can sing it?" shouted the Bear, joyfully, and for once
forgetting to fiddle. "You don't say so!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, of course!" laughed Bo; "everybody in Arkansaw
can do that. It goes this way:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="music/bear3.mid"><img src="images/music3.png" width="400" height="68" alt="Music 3rd Line" title="Music 3rd Line" /></a>
</div>

<div class='poem2'>
"Then the stranger took the fiddle, with a ridy-diddle-diddle,<br />
And the strings began to jingle at the tingle of the bow,<br />
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="music/bear3.mid"><img src="images/music4.png" width="400" height="72" alt="Music 4th Line" title="Music 4th Line" /></a>
</div>

<div class='poem2'>
While the old man sat and listened, and his eyes with pleasure glistened,<br />
As he shouted 'Hallelujah! And hurray&mdash;for&mdash;Joe!'"<br />
</div>

<p>When Bo had finished, Horatio stood perfectly still for
some moments in astonishment and admiration. Then he came
up close to the little boy.</p>

<p>"Look here, Bo," he said, "if you'll teach me to play and
sing that tune, we'll forget all about that sort o' personal supper
I was planning on, and I'll take you home all in one piece. And
anything you want to know I'll tell you, and anything I've got,
except the fiddle, is yours. Furthermore, you can call me Ratio,
too, see?</p>

<div class='poem2'>
'Oh, ridy-diddy, diddy-diddy&mdash;&mdash;'<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>how does it go? Give me a start, please."</div>

<p>Bo brightened up at once. He liked to teach things immensely,
and especially to ask questions.</p>

<p>"Why, of course, Ratio," he said, condescendingly; "I shall
be most happy. And I can make up poetry, too. Ready,
now:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"I am glad to be the teacher of this kind and gentle creature,<br />
Who can play upon the fiddle in a&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
</div>

<p>"Wait, Bo! wait till I catch up!" cried Horatio, excitedly.
"Now!"</p>

<p>"Hold on, Ratio. I want to ask a question!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right! Fire away! I couldn't get any further anyhow."</p>

<p>"Well," said Bo, "I want to know how you ever learned to
play the fiddle."</p>

<p>Horatio did not reply at first, but closed his eyes reflectively
and drew the bow across the string softly.</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"Oh, raddy daddy dum&mdash;daddy dum&mdash;dum&mdash;dum&mdash;-<br />
</div>

<p>"I took a course of lessons," he said, presently, "but it is a long
story, and some of it is not pleasant. I think we had better go
on with the music now:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"Oh, there was a little boy and his name was Bo,<br />
Went out into the woods when the moon was low,<br />
And he met an Old Bear who was hungry for a snack,<br />
And his folks are still awaiting for Bosephus to come back."<br />
</div>

<p>"Go right on with the rest of it," said Bo, hastily.</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"For the boy became the teacher of this kind and gentle creature,<br />
Who can play upon the fiddle in a very skilful way."<br />
</div>

<p>"But I say, Ratio," interrupted Bo again, "how did it come
you never learned to play the second part of that tune?"</p>

<p>Horatio scowled fiercely at first, and then once more grew
quite pensive. He played listlessly as he replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah," he said, "my teacher was&mdash;was unfortunate. He
taught me to play the first part of that tune. He would have
taught me the rest of it&mdash;if he had had time."</p>

<p>Horatio drew the bow lightly across the strings and began
to sing, in a far-away voice:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"Oh, there was an old man, and his name was Jim,<br />
And he had a pet bear who was fond of him;<br />
But the man was very cruel and abusive to his pet,<br />
And one day his people missed him, and they haven't found him yet."<br />
</div>

<p>"Oh!" said Bo; "and w-what happened, Horatio?"</p>

<p>Horatio paused and dashed away a tear.</p>

<p>"It happened in a lonely place," he said, chewing reflectively,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
"a lonely place in the woods, like this. We were both of us
tired and hungry and he grew impatient and beat me. He also
spoke of my parents with disrespect, and in the excitement that
followed he died."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Bo.</p>

<p>"Yes," repeated Horatio, "he died. He was such a nice
man&mdash;such a nice fat Italian man, and so good while&mdash;while he
lasted."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Bo.</p>

<p>Horatio sighed.</p>

<p>"His death quite took away my appetite," he mused. "I
often miss him now, and long for some one to take his place. I
kept this fiddle, though, and he might have been teaching me the
second part of that tune on it now if his people hadn't missed
him&mdash;that is, if he hadn't been impatient, I mean."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ratio!" said Bo, "I will teach you the tune all
through! And I will never be the least bit impatient or&mdash;or
excited. Are you ready to begin, Ratio?"</p>

<p>"All ready! Play."</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"Oh, it's fine to be the teacher of a kind and gentle creature<br />
Who can play upon the fiddle in a very skilful way,<br />
And I'll never, never grieve him, and I'll never, never leave him,<br />
Till I hear the rooster crowing for the break&mdash;of&mdash;day."<br />
</div>

<p>"That was very nice, Bo, very nice indeed!" exclaimed
Horatio, as they finished. "Now, I am going to tell you a secret."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Bo.</p>

<p>"I have a plan. It is to start a colony for the education and
improvement of wild bears. But first I am going to travel and
see the world. I have lived mostly with men and know a good
deal of their taste&mdash;tastes, I mean&mdash;and have already travelled
in some of the States. After my friend, the Italian, was gone, I
tried to carry out his plans and conduct our business alone. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
I could only play the first part of that tune, and the people
wouldn't stand it. They drove me away with guns and clubs.
So I came back to the woods to practice and learn the rest of
that music. My gymnastics are better&mdash;watch me."</p>

<p>Horatio handed Bo his fiddle and began a most wonderful
performance. He stood on his head, walked on his hands,
danced on two feet, three feet, and all fours. Then he began
and turned somersaults innumerable. Bo was delighted.</p>

<p>"It wasn't because you couldn't play and perform well
enough!" he cried, excitedly. "It was because you went alone,
and they thought you were a crazy, wild bear. If I could go
along with you we could travel together over the whole world
and make a fortune. Then we could buy a big swamp and start
your colony. What do you say, Ratio? I am a charity boy, and
have no home anyway! We can make a fortune and see the
world!"</p>

<p>At first Ratio did not say anything. Then he seized Bo in
his arms and hugged him till the boy thought his time had come.
The Bear put him down and held him off at arm's length, joyously.</p>

<p>"Say!" he shouted. "Why, I say that you are a boy after
my own heart! We'll start at once! I'll take you to a place to-night
where there are lots of blackberries and honey, and to-morrow
we will set forth on our travels. Here's my hand as a
guarantee of safety as long as you keep your agreement. You
mean to do so, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Bo.</p>

<p>"And now for camp. We can play and sing as we go."</p>

<p>As the little boy took Horatio's big paw he ceased to be
even the least bit afraid. He had at last found a strong friend,
and was going forth into the big world. He had never been so
happy in his life before.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right, Ratio!" he shouted. "One, two, three, play!"</p>

<p>And Ratio gave the bow a long, joyous scrape across the
strings, and thus they began their life together&mdash;Bosephus whistling
and the Bear playing and singing with all his might the
fascinating strains of "The Arkansaw Traveller":&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"Oh, there was a little boy and his name was Bo,<br />
Went out into the woods when the moon was low,<br />
And he hadn't had his supper and his way he didn't know,<br />
So he didn't have a bite to eat nor any place to go.<br />
Then he heard the ridy-diddle of Horatio and his fiddle,<br />
And his knees began to tremble as he saw him standing there;<br />
Now they'll never, never sever, and they'll travel on forever&mdash;<br />
Bosephus, and the fiddle, and the Old&mdash;Black&mdash;Bear."<br />

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE FIRST PERFORMANCE</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="music/bear1.mid"><img src="images/music1.png" width="400" height="68" alt="Music 1st Line" title="Music 1st Line" /></a>
</div>


<div class='poem'>
"Oh, 'twas down in the woods of the Arkansaw<br />
I met an Old Bear with a very nimble paw;<br />
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="music/bear2.mid"><img src="images/music2.png" width="400" height="77" alt="Music 2nd Line" title="Music 2nd line" /></a>
</div>

<div class='poem2'>
He could dance and he could fiddle at the only tune he knew,<br />
And he fiddled and he fiddled, but he never played it through."<br /><br />
</div>


<div class='cap'>BO was awake first, and Horatio still lay sound asleep.
As the boy paused the Bear opened one eye sleepily
and reached lazily toward his fiddle, but dropped asleep
again before his paw touched it. They had found a
very cosy place in a big heap of dry leaves under some spreading
branches, and Horatio, though fond of music, was still more
fond of his morning nap. Bosephus looked at him a moment
and began singing again, in the same strain:&mdash;</div>

<div class='poem2'>
"Then there came a little boy who could whistle all the tune,<br />
And he whistled and he sang it by the rising of the moon;<br />
And he whistled and he whistled, and he sang it o'er and o'er,<br />
Till Horatio learned the music he had never learned before."<br />
</div>

<p>The Bear opened the other eye, and once more reached for
his fiddle. This time he got hold of it, but before his other paw
touched the bow he was asleep again. Bo waited a moment.
Then he suddenly began singing to the other part of the tune:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="music/bear3.mid"><img src="images/music3.png" width="400" height="68" alt="Music 3rd Line" title="Music 3rd Line" /></a>
</div>

<div class='poem2'>
"Yes, he learned it all so neatly and he played it all so sweetly<br />
That he fell in love completely with the boy without a home;<br />

And he said, 'No matter whether it is dark or sunny weather<br />
We will travel on together till the cows&mdash;come&mdash;home.'"<br />
</div>

<p>Before Bosephus finished the first two lines of this strain
Horatio was sitting up straight and fiddling for dear life.</p>

<p>"Once more, Bo, once more!" he shouted as they finished.</p>

<p>They repeated the music, and Horatio turned two handsprings
without stopping.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "we will go forth and conquer the world."</p>

<p>"I could conquer some breakfast first," said Bo.</p>

<p>"Do you like roasting ears?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Bo.</p>

<p>"Well, I have an interest in a little patch near here&mdash;that
is, I take an interest, I should say, and you can take part of mine
or one of your own if you prefer. It really doesn't make any
difference which you do just so you take it before the man that
planted it is up."</p>

<p>"Why," exclaimed the boy as they came out into a little
clearing, "that is old Zack Todd's field!"</p>

<p>"It is, is it? Well, how did old Zack Todd get it, I'd like to
know."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why I don't know," answered Bo, puzzled.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i009.jpg" width="500" height="317" alt="&quot;ONCE MORE, BO, ONCE MORE&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;ONCE MORE, BO, ONCE MORE&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Of course not," said the Bear. "And now, Bosephus, let
me tell you something. The bears owned that field long before
old Zack Todd was ever thought of. We're just renting it to
him on shares. This is rent day. We don't need to wake Zack<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
up. You get over the fence and hand me a few of the best ears
you can get quick and handy, and you might bring one of those
watermelons I see in the corn there, and we'll find a quiet place
that I know of and eat it."</p>

<p>Bo hopped lightly over the rail fence, and, gathering an
armful of green corn, handed it to Horatio. Then he turned to
select a melon.</p>

<p>"Has Zack Todd got a gun, Bosephus?" asked the Bear.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir-ee. The best gun in Arkansaw, and he's a dead
shot with it."</p>

<p>"Oh, he is. Well, maybe you better not be quite so slow
picking out that melon. Just take the first big one you see and
come on."</p>

<p>"Why, Zack wouldn't care for us collecting rent, would he?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know. You see, some folks are peculiar
that way. Zack might forget it was rent day, and a man with a
bad memory and a good gun can't be trusted. Especially when
he's a dead shot. There, that one will do. Never mind about
his receipt&mdash;we'll mail it to him."</p>

<p>Bo scrambled back over the fence with the melon and hastened
as fast as he could after Horatio, who was already moving
across the clearing with his violin under one arm and the green
ears under the other.</p>

<p>"Wait, Ratio," called the little boy. "This melon is heavy."</p>

<p>"Is that a long range gun, Bo?" called back the Bear.</p>

<p>"Carries a mile and a half."</p>

<p>"Can't you move up a little faster, Bo? I'm afraid, after all,
that melon is bigger than we needed."</p>

<p>The boy was fat and he panted after his huge companion.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a sharp report, and Bosephus saw a little
tuft of fur fly from one of his companion's ears. Horatio
dodged frantically and dropped part of his corn.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">CONQUERING THE WORLD.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"Run zigzag, Bo!" he called, "and don't drop the melon.
Run zigzag. He can't hit you so well then," and Horatio himself
began such a performance of running first one way and
then the other that Bo was almost obliged to laugh in spite of
their peril.</p>

<p>"Is this what you call conquering the world, Ratio?"
Then, as he followed the Bear's example, he caught a backward
glimpse out of the corner of his eye.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ratio," he called, "the whole family is after us. Zack
Todd, and old Mis' Todd, and Jim, and the girls."</p>

<p>"How many times does that gun shoot?"</p>

<p>"Only once without loading."</p>

<p>"Muzzle loader?"</p>

<p>"Yep," panted Bo. "Old style."</p>

<p>"Good! Hold on to that melon. We'll get to the woods
yet."</p>

<p>But Horatio was mistaken, for just as they dashed into the
edge of the timber, with the pursuers getting closer every moment,
right in front of them was a high barbed-wire fence which
the Todd family had built around the clearing but a few days
before. The Bear dropped his corn, and the boy carefully, but
with some haste, put down the melon. Then they turned. The
Todd family was just entering the woods&mdash;old Zack and the
gun in front. He had loaded it and was putting on the cap as
he ran.</p>

<p>"What shall we do, Bo, what shall we do now?" groaned
Horatio.</p>

<p>The situation was indeed desperate. Their pursuers were
upon them, and in a moment more the deadly gun would be
levelled. Suddenly a bright thought occurred to Bo.</p>

<p>"I know," he shouted; "dance! Horatio! dance!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i011.jpg" width="500" height="457" alt="&quot;DANCE! HORATIO, DANCE!&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;DANCE! HORATIO, DANCE!&quot;</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Horatio still had his fiddle under his arm. He threw it into
position and ran the bow over the strings. In a second more he
was playing and dancing, and Bo was singing as though it were
a matter of life and death, which indeed it was:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="music/bear1.mid"><img src="images/music1.png" width="400" height="68" alt="Music 1st Line" title="Music 1st Line" /></a>
</div>


<div class='poem2'>
"Oh, there was a fine man and a mighty fine gun<br />
And a Bear that played the fiddle and a boy that couldn't run,<br />
</div>

</div>


<div class='poem2'>
And the boy was named Bosephus and Horatio the Bear,<br />
And they couldn't find a bite to eat for breakfast anywhere."<br />
</div>

<p>The Todd family stood still at this unexpected performance
and stared at the two musicians. Old man Todd leaned
his gun against a tree.</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"Now they couldn't buy their breakfast for their money all was spent,<br />
So they dropped into a cornfield to collect a little rent;<br />
But they only took a melon and an ear of corn or so,<br />
And were going off to eat them where the butter blossoms grow."<br />
</div>

<p>The Todd family were falling into the swing of the music.
Old Mis' Todd and the girls were swaying back and forth and
the men were beating time with their feet. Suddenly Bosephus
changed to the second part of the tune.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="music/bear3.mid"><img src="images/music3.png" width="400" height="68" alt="Music 3rd Line" title="Music 3rd Line" /></a>
</div>

<div class='poem2'>
"But the old man got up early with a temper rather surly,<br />

<a href="music/bear3.mid"><img src="images/music4.png" width="400" height="72" alt="Music 4th Line" title="Music 4th Line" /></a>
</div>

<div class='poem2'>
Till he heard the ridy-diddle of Horatio and his fiddle,<br />
Then he shouted, 'Hallelujah, girls, and all&mdash;hands&mdash;'round!'"<br />
</div>

<p>The first line of this had started the Todd family. Old
Zack swung old Mis' Todd, and Jim swung the girls. Then all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
joined hands and circled to the left. They circled around Bosephus
and Horatio, who kept on with the music, faster and
faster. Then there was a grand right and left and balance all&mdash;every
one for himself&mdash;until they were breathless and could
dance no more. Horatio stopped fiddling and when old man
Todd could catch his breath he said to Bo:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look a-here; that Bear of yours is a whole show by himself,
and you're another. Anybody that can play and sing like
that can have anything I've got. There's my house and there's
my cornfield; help yourselves."</p>

<p>Bo thanked him and said that the corn and the melon already
selected would do for the time. To oblige them, however,
he would take up a modest collection. He passed his hat
and received a silver twenty-five cent piece, a spool of thread
with a needle in it, a one-bladed jack-knife and two candy hearts
with mottoes on them&mdash;these last being from the girls, who
blushed and giggled as they contributed. Then he said good-by,
and the Todd family showed them a gate that led into the
thick woods. As the friends passed out of sight and hearing
Bosephus paused and waved his handkerchief to the girls. A
little later Horatio turned to him and said, impressively:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That is what I call conquering the world, Bosephus. We
began a little sooner and more abruptly than I had expected,
but it was not badly done, and, all things considered, you did
your part very well, Bosephus; very well indeed."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>HORATIO AND THE DOGS</h3>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="music/bear1.mid"><img src="images/music1.png" width="400" height="68" alt="Music 1st Line" title="Music 1st Line" /></a>
</div>


<div class='poem2'>
"Blossom on the bough and bird on the limb&mdash;<br />
Old Black Bear sits a-grinning at him;<br />
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="music/bear2.mid"><img src="images/music2.png" width="400" height="77" alt="Music 2nd Line" title="Music 2nd line" /></a>
</div>

<div class='poem2'>
Sawing on his fiddle and a-grinning at the jay&mdash;<br />
Grinning as he saws the only tune that he can play."<br /><br />
</div>


<div class='cap'>HORATIO leaned back against the tree and played
lazily. Bosephus lay stretched full length on the
leaves, following idly with any words that happened to
fit the strain. A blue jay just over their heads bobbed
up and down on a limber branch, waiting for them to go. The
Bear took up the song as the boy paused:&mdash;</div>

<div class='poem2'>
"Boy on the bank and bird on the tree&mdash;<br />
Bird keeps a-bobbing and a-blinking at me;<br />
Bobbing and a-blinking, and a-waiting for a bite&mdash;<br />
Hasn't had a thing to eat since late&mdash;last&mdash;night."<br />
</div>

<p>"I say, Ratio," interrupted Bo. "Suppose we move on and
give Mr. Jay Bird a chance?"</p>

<p>Horatio grunted and rose heavily. After their adventure
with the Todd family they had come to a pleasant spot in the
woods by a clear stream of water. Bo, who had some matches
in his pocket, had kindled a fire and roasted some of the corn,
much to the disgust of Horatio, who disliked fire and asked him
why he didn't roast the watermelon, too, while he was about it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Then they had eaten their breakfast together and taken a brief
rest before setting forth again on their travels. A jay bird was
waiting to peck the gnawed ears and melon rinds. He stared at
the strange pair as they strolled away through the trees, the
Bear continuing his favorite melody.</p>

<p>"Ratio," said Bo, pausing suddenly, "what is that I hear
scurrying through the bushes every now and then?"</p>

<p>"Friends of mine, likely."</p>

<p>"Friends! What friends?"</p>

<p>"Oh, everything, most. Wild cats, wolves, foxes and a few
wild bears, maybe."</p>

<p>"Wildcats! Bears! Wolves!"</p>

<p>"Why, yes. Often when I play in the moonlight they come
out and dance for me."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Bo.</p>

<p>"I have them all dancing together, sometimes. I'll have
them dance for you before long."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ratio, will you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It's a lot of fun, but there's no money in it, and
that's what we're after now, Bo. We're going to buy that
swamp, you remember, and start that bear colony."</p>

<p>Bosephus was about to reply when Horatio paused and listened.
There was the distant sound of dogs barking.</p>

<p>"Hello!" said Bo. "We're coming to somewhere. Now
we'll give our first regular performance. Come on, Ratio!"</p>

<p>Horatio hesitated.</p>

<p>"How many dogs do you suppose there are, Bo?" he asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>"About a dozen, I should think, big and little."</p>

<p>"Little dogs, Bo? Little snapping dogs?"</p>

<p>"That's what it sounds like, and some hounds and a big dog
or two. You don't mind dogs, do you?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i014.jpg" width="450" height="411" alt="&quot;HELLO!&quot; SAID BO, &quot;WE&#39;RE COMING TO SOMEWHERE.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;HELLO!&quot; SAID BO, &quot;WE&#39;RE COMING TO SOMEWHERE.&quot;</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no, not in the least&mdash;but it's most too soon after
breakfast to give a performance, and besides, all that noise
would spoil the music."</p>

<p>But the little boy, who still had in his pocket the two candy
hearts that had been given to him by the Todd girls, walked
ahead proudly.</p>

<p>"You trust to me!" he said, flourishing a large stick. "I'll
stop their noise pretty quick. I'm not afraid of dogs!"</p>

<p>The Bear followed some steps behind, looking ahead warily.</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid, either, you know," he said, anxiously.
"Only when there are so many of them they get me mixed up
on my notes and one of them once had the ill manners to nip
quite a piece out of my left hind leg."</p>

<p>Presently they came into an open space and plump upon a
little crossroads village. A gang of dogs gambolled upon the
common, chasing stray geese and barking loudly. Horatio
paused.</p>

<p>"Come back, Bo," he whispered. "There's no money in
that crowd."</p>

<p>But Bosephus was already some distance ahead, stick in
hand, and the dogs had spied him. They ceased barking for a
moment and two or three of the larger ones ran away. Then
the little dogs began yelping again and came on in a swarm. Bo
made at them with his stick, but they dodged past him, and in
a moment more were circling and snapping around Horatio,
who was waving his violin wildly with one paw and slapping like
a man killing mosquitoes with the other.</p>

<p>"Quick, Bo!" he shouted. "Quick! Help! Murder!"</p>

<p>The little boy wanted to laugh, but ran up instead and began
striking among the bevy of dogs that were torturing his
friend. Some of them howled and ran off a few paces. Then
they came flocking back. Suddenly Horatio thrust his violin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
into Bo's hand and ran swiftly toward a large tree a few yards
distant. The curs followed and jumped high into the air after
him as he scrambled up to the lower limbs.</p>

<p>Bosephus hurried after them and struck at them so fiercely
with his club that they ran yelping away. A number of villagers,
attracted by the commotion, were now appearing from all
quarters.</p>

<p>"Here come the people, Ratio," said Bo, grinning. "Now
we can perform."</p>

<p>"All right, Bo," whispered the Bear, "but if you'll kindly hand
me up that fiddle I believe I'll perform right where I am."</p>

<p>The boy passed up the violin and the Bear struck a few
notes. By this time the people had collected. There was a
blacksmith with a leather apron, and a painter with all colors
of paint on his clothes. Behind them there came a woman
with dough on her hands and another carrying a baby. Other
men and women followed in the procession, and a dozen or so
children of all ages. They halted a little way from the tree and
stood staring. Horatio sat astride a big limb and commenced
playing. Suddenly the boy threw back his head and began to
sing:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"Oh, the dogs barked loud and the dogs barked low<br />
And the boy stood still and the Bear climbed the tree,<br />
At an Old Black Bear and a boy named Bo.<br />
While the people came a-running to see what they could see."<br />
</div>

<p>The children drew up close at the first line and held their
breath to listen. As the boy paused they shouted and screamed
with laughter at the sight of Horatio fiddling in the forks of
the tree. The dogs sat in a row and howled plaintively.</p>

<p>"Sing some more," cried the woman with the baby; "it
amuses my little Joey."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">BOSEPHUS HURRIED AFTER THEM AND STRUCK AT THEM.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem2'>
"Yes, the people came to see them and the dogs they ran away,<br />
And the boy began to sing and the Bear began to play,<br />
Till it tickled all the children and it made the baby crow,<br />
And it set the people dancing till they jumped&mdash;Jim&mdash;Crow."<br />
</div>

<p>"More! more!" shouted the people as they formed into
cotillons and reels. "Sing us some more!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="music/bear3.mid"><img src="images/music3.png" width="400" height="68" alt="Music 3rd Line" title="Music 3rd Line" /></a>
</div>

<div class='poem2'>
"Oh, the ridy-diddle-diddle of Horatio and his fiddle,<br />
And the singing of Bosephus they had never heard before;<br />
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="music/bear3.mid"><img src="images/music4.png" width="400" height="72" alt="Music 4th Line" title="Music 4th Line" /></a>
</div>

<div class='poem2'>
And it set them all to spinning, and the music was so winning<br />
That they wined them and they dined them until half past four!"<br />
</div>

<p>"Wait! wait!" called the woman with the baby under her
arm, "I'm all out of breath."</p>

<p>"No, no!" shouted the children and all the others. "Go on!
Go on!"</p>

<p>So once more and yet another time the unwearied musicians
repeated their performance, and then Bo politely passed
his hat to the dancers. When he had been to each one his hat
was heavy with some money and many useful articles.</p>

<p>"Bring your Bear down out of the tree," said the blacksmith,
"and we will give you a feast on the common."</p>

<p>Bo beckoned to Horatio to climb down, but the big fellow
hesitated.</p>

<p>The temptation of a feast, however, was too much for him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 317px;">
<img src="images/i016.jpg" width="317" height="450" alt="ONCE MORE AND YET ANOTHER TIME." title="" />
<span class="caption">ONCE MORE AND YET ANOTHER TIME.</span>
</div>

<p>That night, when they had both danced again for the people
and Horatio had given them an acrobatic exhibition, they
strolled away through the evening loaded down with luxuries of
all kinds. The villagers went with them to the outskirts, and
called good luck after them. As they passed into the quiet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
shadows of the forest they once more heard the barking of dogs
in the distance behind them.</p>

<p>"We have had a good day, Bosephus," said Horatio, with a
long sigh of satisfaction. "We are on the road to fortune. To
be sure, there are little thorns along the way&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dogs, for instance&mdash;and guns."</p>

<p>"Trifles, Bosephus; trifles. Don't give them a second
thought. Of course you are only a little boy as yet, and will
outgrow these fears."</p>

<p>"And learn to climb trees."</p>

<p>"I hope you don't think I climbed that tree out of fear, Bosephus.
I merely went up there to get a better view of my audience.
One should always rise above his audience. And now
let us sing softly together as we go. It will rest us after our day
of conquest."</p>

<p>And touching the strings lightly and singing softly together,
the friends sought leisurely their evening camp. Here
and there a light rustle in the bushes showed that the forest people
were listening, and the leaves of the forest whispered in time
to their melody.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>THE DANCE OF THE FOREST PEOPLE</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="music/bear1.mid"><img src="images/music1.png" width="400" height="68" alt="Music 1st Line" title="Music 1st Line" /></a>
</div>


<div class='poem2'>
"Oh! the night was warm and the moon was bright,<br />
And we pitched our camp in the pale moonlight;<br />
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="music/bear2.mid"><img src="images/music2.png" width="400" height="77" alt="Music 2nd Line" title="Music 2nd line" /></a>
</div>

<div class='poem2'>
In the pale moonlight and the green, green shade,<br />
And we counted up together all the money we had made."<br /><br />
</div>


<div class='cap'>THE little boy jingled the coins in his hands, and sang
reflectively to the Bear's soft music. Their camp fire
had died down to a few red embers, and the big moon
hanging in the tree-tops made all the world white and
black, with one bright splash in the brook below. They had finished
their supper, and Bosephus, with the needle and thread
given to him by old Mis' Todd, had patiently mended by the firelight
a small rent in his trouser leg. Horatio, watching him
with a grin, had finally remarked:&mdash;</div>

<p>"You see, Bo, if you wore clothes like mine you wouldn't
have to do that."</p>

<p>"And if the dog that did that had got his teeth into your
clothes, you'd have wished they were like mine. Maybe that's
why you didn't give him a chance."</p>

<p>"Let's count the money, Bo."</p>

<p>So then they counted up their day's receipts. There was
something more than a dollar in all, and Horatio was much
pleased.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i018.jpg" width="400" height="455" alt="THEIR CAMP-FIRE HAD DIED DOWN." title="" />
<span class="caption">THEIR CAMP-FIRE HAD DIED DOWN.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"I tell you, Bo," he said excitedly, "we've made a fine start.
By and by we will earn two or three times that much every day,
and be able to start our bear colony before you know it."</p>

<p>The little boy fondled the coins over and over. They were
the first he had ever earned.</p>

<p>"Ratio," he said at last, "don't you suppose when we get a
lot of money&mdash;a big lot, I mean&mdash;we might give some to those
people I used to live with?"</p>

<p>Horatio scowled.</p>

<p>"I thought you said they didn't treat you well and you had
to run away."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, Ratio; but then they were so poor and maybe
they'd have been better to me if I had been able to earn money
for them. They did take me out of the poor house, you know,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you tried to get back again and got lost and fell in
with me. Now you are sorry and want to go to them, do you?"
and the Bear snorted so fiercely that the little boy trembled.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Not for the world! I never was so happy in all
my life, only I just thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then don't think, Bo," interrupted Horatio, gently. "You
are only a little boy. I will do the thinking for this firm. Now
for a song, Bo, to soothe us."</p>

<p>So then they played and sang softly together while the
moon rose and the fire died out, and the boy poured the money
from hand to hand, lovingly.</p>

<p>"Bosephus," said his companion, as they paused, "were
those people you lived with nice people? Nice fat people, I
mean?"</p>

<p>"Not very. Old Mr. Sugget might have been pretty fat
if he'd had more to eat, but Mis' Sugget wasn't made to get
fat, I know. It wasn't her build."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was the old man that abused you, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Well, mostly."</p>

<p>"Knocked you about and half starved you?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes, but then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait, please. I have an idea. When we get our bear colony
started we'll invite this Sugget party to visit us. We'll feed
him&mdash;all he can eat. By and by, when he gets fat&mdash;how long
do you suppose it will take him to get fat, Bo? Fat enough, I
mean?"</p>

<p>"Fat enough for what?" shivered Bo.</p>

<p>Horatio drew the horsehair briskly across the strings and
looked up at the moon.</p>

<p>"Fat enough to be entertaining," he grinned, and began
singing:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"Oh, there was an old man and his ways were mighty mean,<br />
And he wasn't very fat and he wasn't very lean,<br />
Till he went to pay a visit to a colony of bears,<br />
Then you couldn't find a nicer man than he was, anywheres."<br />
</div>

<p>While the Bear played the little boy had been watching a
slim, moving shadow that seemed to have drifted out from
among the heavier shadows into the half-lit open space in front
of them. As the music ceased it drifted back again.</p>

<p>"Play some more, Ratio," he whispered.</p>

<p>Again the Bear played and again the slim shadow appeared
in the moonlight and presently another and another. Some of
them were slender and graceful; some of them heavier and
slower of movement. As the music continued they swung into a
half circle and drew closer. Now and then the boy caught a
glimpse of two shining sparks that kept time and movement
with each. He could hardly breathe in his excitement.</p>

<p>"Look there, Ratio," he whispered.</p>

<p>Horatio did not stir.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sh-h!" he said softly. "My friends&mdash;the forest people."</p>

<p>The Bear slackened the music a little as he spoke and
the shadows wavered and drew away. Then he livened the
strain and they trooped forward again eagerly.</p>

<p>Just then the moon swung clear of the thick trees and the
dancers were in its full flood. The boy watched them with
trembling eagerness.</p>

<p>A tall, catlike creature, erect and graceful, swayed like a
phantom in and out among the others, and seemed to lead. As
it came directly in front of the musicians it turned full front
toward them. It was an immense gray panther.</p>

<p>At any other time Bo would have screamed. Now he was
only fascinated. Its step was perfect and its long tail waved behind
it, like a silver plume, which the others followed. Two red
foxes kept pace with it. Two gray ones, a little to one side,
imitated their movements. In the background a family of three
bears danced so awkwardly that Bo was inclined to laugh.</p>

<p>"We will teach them to do better than that when we get
our colony," he said.</p>

<p>Horatio nodded without pausing. The dancers separated,
each group to itself, the gray panther in the foreground. Spellbound,
the boy watched the beautiful swaying creature. He
had been taught to fear the "painter," as it was called in Arkansaw,
but he had no fear now. He almost felt that he must
himself step out into that enchanted circle and join in the weird
dance.</p>

<p>New arrivals stole constantly out of the darkness to mingle
in the merrymaking. A little way apart a group of rabbits
skipped wildly together, while near them a party of capering
wolves had forgotten their taste for blood. Two plump 'coons
and a heavy bodied 'possum, after trying in vain to keep up with
the others, were content to sit side by side and look on. Other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
friends, some of whom the boy did not know, slipped out into
the magic circle, and, after watching the others for a moment,
leaped madly into the revel. The instinct of the old days had
claimed them when the wild beasts of the forest and the wood
nymphs trod measures to the pipes of Pan. The boy leaned
close to the player.</p>

<p>"The rest of it!" he whispered. "Play the rest of it!"</p>

<p>"I am afraid. They have never heard it before."</p>

<p>"Play it! Play it!" commanded Bo, excitedly.</p>

<p>There was a short, sharp pause at the end of the next bar,
then a sudden wild dash into the second half of the tune. The
prancing animals stopped as if by magic. For an instant they
stood motionless, staring with eyes like coals. Then came a
great rush forward, the gray panther at the head. The boy saw
them coming, but could not move.</p>

<p>"Sing!" shouted Horatio; "sing!"</p>

<p>For a second the words refused to come. Then they flooded
forth in the moonlight. Bo could sing, and he had never
sung as he did now.</p>

<span class="caption">THE INSTINCT OF THE OLD DAYS HAD CLAIMED THEM.</span>
</div>

<p>At the first notes of the boy's clear voice the animals hesitated;
then they crept up slowly and gathered about to listen.
They did not resume dancing to this new strain. Perhaps they
wanted to learn it first. Bo sang on and on. The listening audience<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
never moved. Then Horatio played very softly, and the
singer lowered his voice until it became like a far off echo.
When Bo sang like this he often closed his eyes. He did so now.</p>

<p>The music sank lower and lower, until it died away in a
whisper. The boy ceased singing and opening his eyes gazed
about him. Here and there he imagined he heard a slight rustle
in the leaves, but the gray panther was gone. The frisking rabbits
and the capering wolves had vanished. The red and gray
foxes, the awkward bears and the rest of that frolicking throng
had melted back into the shadows. So far as he could peer into
the dim forest he was alone with his faithful friend.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>GOOD-BYE TO ARKANSAW</h3>

<div class='poem2'>
"Oh, the wind blows cold and the wind blows raw,<br />
When the night comes on in the Arkansaw&mdash;<br />
Yes, the wind blows cold and the snow will fall.<br />
And Bosephus and Horatio must travel through it all."<br /><br />
</div>


<div class='cap'>THE little boy's voice quavered as he sang, and his
teeth chattered. It had been more than two months
since he started on his travels with Horatio, and the
October nights, even in southern Arkansaw, were beginning
to be chilly. The night before he had in some way got
separated from his friend's warm furry coat and woke shivering.
He kindled a fire now, singing as he worked, while Horatio
touched the chords of his violin pensively. He did not feel the
cold. Nature was providing him with his winter furs.</div>

<p>"Bo," he said presently, "you'll have to have some heavier
clothes. Either that or we'll have to go farther South. As for
me, you know, I could go to sleep in a hollow tree and not mind
the winter, but you couldn't do it, and I don't intend to, either,
this year; we're making too much money for that."</p>

<p>Bo laughed in spite of the cold and jingled his pockets.
They were more than half full of coin, and he had a good roll of
bills in his jacket besides.</p>

<p>"No," he said; "we are getting along too well. We'll be
rich by spring if we keep right on. I'm thinking, though, that
we'll never be able to get South fast enough if we walk."</p>

<p>"Look here, Bo; you're not thinking about putting me on
that cyclone thing they call a train, are you?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, not exactly, but yesterday where we performed I
heard a fellow say that there was a river right close here, and
steamboats. You wouldn't mind a steamboat, would you,
Ratio?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. I don't mind anything. I've always
wanted to ride on one of those trains, only I knew the people
would be frightened at me, and as for a steamboat, why, if I
should meet a steamboat coming down the road&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But steamboats don't come down the roads, Ratio; they
go on the water."</p>

<p>"Water! Water that you drink, and drown things in?"</p>

<p>"Of course! And if the boat goes down we'll be drowned,
too."</p>

<p>Horatio struck a few notes on the violin before replying.</p>

<p>"Bo," he said presently, "you're a friend of mine, aren't you?
A true friend?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Ratio, you know I am."</p>

<p>"Well, then, don't you go on one of those boats. It would
grieve me terribly if anything should happen to you. I might
not be able to save you, Bo, and then think how lonely I should
be." And Horatio put one paw to his eyes and sobbed.</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw, Ratio! Why, I can swim like everything.
I'm not afraid."</p>

<p>"But you couldn't save us both, Bo&mdash;I mean, we both
couldn't save the fiddle&mdash;it would get wet. Think&mdash;think of
the fiddle, Bo!"</p>

<p>The fire was burning brightly by this time and the little
boy was getting warm. He laughed and rubbed his hands
and began to sing:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"Oh, we're going down the river on a great big boat,<br />
And Horatio's so excited he can hardly play a note,<br />
For he never liked the water and he never learned to swim,<br />
And he thinks if he goes sailing now his chances will be slim."<br /></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Horatio stopped short and snorted angrily.</p>

<p>"I want you to understand," he said, sharply, "that I'm
not afraid of anything. You'll please remember that night
when the forest people danced and you thought your time had
come, how I saved you by making you sing. There's nothing
I fear. Why if&mdash;"</p>

<p>But what Horatio was about to say will never be known,
for at that moment there came such a frightful noise as neither
of them had ever heard before. It came from everywhere at
once, and seemed to fill all the sky and set the earth to trembling.
It was followed by two or three fierce snorts and a dazzling
gleam of light through the trees. The little boy was startled,
and as for the Bear, he gave one wild look and fled. In his
fright he did not notice a small shrub, and, tripping over it, he
fell headlong into a clump of briars, where he lay, groaning dismally
that he was killed and that the world was coming to an
end.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bosephus gave a shout of laughter.</p>

<p>"Get up, Ratio," he called, "it's our steamboat! We're right
near the river and didn't know it. They're landing, too, and we
can go right aboard."</p>

<p>The groaning ceased and there was a labored movement
among the briars.</p>

<p>Presently Horatio crept out, very much crestfallen, and
picked up the violin, which in his haste he had dropped.</p>

<p>"Bo," he said, sheepishly, "I never told you about it before,
but I am subject to fits. I had one just then. They come on
suddenly that way. All my family have them and act strangely
at times. I'm sure you don't think for a moment that I was
frightened just now."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 420px;">
<img src="images/i021.jpg" width="420" height="500" alt="HE FELL HEADLONG." title="" />
<span class="caption">HE FELL HEADLONG.</span>
</div>

<p>"Oh, no, of course not. You merely picked out that briar
patch as a good place to have a fit in. Do you always think the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
world's coming to an end when you are taken that way?"</p>

<p>"We'll go right aboard, Bo; you are a little timid, no doubt,
so I'll lead the way." And Horatio stepped out briskly toward
the lights and voices and the landing steamer.</p>

<p>A few steps brought them out to the river bank and a full
view of the boat that had crept silently around a bend to the
woodyard, where it was halting to take on fuel. The gang plank
had not been pushed out to the bank as yet, but a white ray of
light shot from a small window to the dark shore and looked
exactly like a narrow board. The boy and the Bear were both
deceived by it, and Horatio in his eagerness to show his bravery
did not pause to investigate.</p>

<p>"Take the fiddle, Bo," he said, loftily, "and I'll show you
how to get on a boat. You should always be brave, Bosephus."</p>

<p>Bosephus took the instrument and Horatio, with arms extended
as a balance, stepped straight out into nothing and vanished.
There was a sudden splash, a growl, a scrambling sound
in the shallow water and Horatio's head appeared above the
bank. Bosephus, at first frightened, was now doubled with
laughter.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ratio," he gasped, "how funny of you to try to walk
on a moonbeam!"</p>

<p>Horatio shook himself and sniffed angrily. A wide gang
plank was now being lowered from the boat, and as it touched
the bank the boy stepped quickly aboard, followed by the wet,
shambling Bear.</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"Oh, there was an Old Bear on a dark, dark night,<br />
Who tried to walk on a beam of light,"<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>sang Bo, as he crossed the plank,</div>

<div class='poem2'>
"But the beam wouldn't hold and the Bear broke through,<br />
And now Horatio follows, as Horatio ought to do."<br /></div><p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hello!" called a voice. "Where did you come from?"</p>

<p>Bo looked up and saw a brawny man with a group of wondering
negroes behind him.</p>

<p>"We are travelling," said Bo, "and we want to go down the
river. We can pay our way and will make music for you, too."</p>

<p>"Good boy," said the mate. "Go right up and report to the
clerk, then come back down here, and after we get this wood
loaded we'll give you some supper and you can give us a show."</p>

<p>On the upper deck the few passengers gathered around
and made much of the arrivals. All asked questions at once,
and Bo answered as best he could. Horatio kept silent&mdash;he
never talked except when he was alone with Bo. The boy kept
his hand on the Bear's head, and when the boat backed away
and puffed down stream he felt his big friend tremble, but a little
later, when they had had a good supper, Ratio's fear passed
off, and on the lower deck, where all hands collected, the friends
gave an entertainment that not only won for them free passage
down the river, but a good collection besides. It was far in the
night when the performance ended. The officers, passengers
and crew kept calling for more, and the travellers were anxious
to accommodate them. The negroes went wild over the music,
and patted and danced crazily whenever Horatio played. Finally
Bo sang a good night song:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Bosephus and Horatio were both offered staterooms on
the upper deck, but Horatio preferred to sleep outside, and the
little boy said he would sleep there also. Horatio sat up for
some moments after Bo had stretched himself to rest, looking
at the dark wooded banks and the starlight on the water behind
them.</p>

<p>"Bo," he said, at last, "we are going to see the world now,
sure enough."</p>

<p>"Yes, Ratio," was the sleepy answer.</p>

<p>"Bo, do you suppose our camp fire is still burning back
yonder?"</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>"I hate to leave old Arkansaw, don't you, Bo?"</p>

<p>But the little boy was in the land of dreams.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>AN EXCITING RACE</h3>

<div class='poem2'>
"Sailing down the river so early in the morn,<br />
Sailing down the river so early in the morn,<br />
Sailing down the river so early in the morn,<br />
Never was so happy since the day that I was born."<br /><br />
</div>


<div class='cap'>THE boat on which Horatio and Bosephus had taken
their passage made no landings during the night, and
the little boy and the big Bear slept soundly on the
deck together. Rather too soundly, as will be seen
later. At daybreak the next morning Bosephus was wide awake,
singing softly and watching through the mist the queer forms
of the cypress trees, with the long Spanish moss swinging from
the limbs. Horatio, hearing the singing, rubbed his eyes and
sat up. He had never been so far South before, so the scenery
was new to both of them, and when they came to open spaces
and saw that the shores were only a few inches higher than the
river and that fields of waving green came right to the water's
edge they were both pleased and surprised at this new world.
The climate had changed, too, and the air was warm and spring-like.</div>

<p>"I tell you, Bo," said Horatio grandly, "there's nothing like
travel. You're a lucky boy, Bo, to fall in with me. Why, the
way you've come out in the last few months is wonderful. Of
course, there is a good deal of room yet for improvement, and
there are still some things that you are rather timid of, but when
I remember how you looked the first minute I saw you, and
then to see the sociable way you sit up and talk to me now, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
really don't seem like the same boy, Bosephus, you really don't."</p>

<p>The little boy leaned up close to his companion.</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"Oh, there was a little boy and his name was Bo,"<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>he sang softly, remembering their first meeting.</div>

<div class='poem2'>
"Went out into the woods when the moon was low,"<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>added the Bear, strumming lightly the strings of the violin.</div>

<div class='poem2'>
"And he met an Old Bear that was hungry for a snack,<br />
And the folks are still awaiting for Bosephus to come back."<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>they continued together in a half whisper.</div>

<p>"Ratio," said the little boy, confidentially, "did you really
intend to&mdash;to have me&mdash;you know, Ratio&mdash;for&mdash;for supper until
I taught you the tune? Did you, Ratio?"</p>

<p>Horatio gazed away across a broad cane field, where the
first streak of sunrise was beginning to show.</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"For the boy became the teacher of the kind and gentle creature<br />
Who could play upon the fiddle in a very skilful way,"<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>he sang dreamily, and then both together once more:&mdash;</div>

<div class='poem2'>
"Now he'll never, never leave him, and he'll never, never grieve him,<br />
And we're singing here together at the break&mdash;of&mdash;day."<br />
</div>

<p>"This is very pleasant travelling," commented Horatio
thoughtfully. "It beats walking, at least for speed and comfort.
Of course, there are a number of places we cannot reach
by boat," he added, regretfully.</p>

<p>"Not in Southern Louisiana, Ratio. I've heard that there's
a regular tangle of rivers and bayous all over the country, and
that boats go everywhere."</p>

<p>Horatio looked pleased.</p>

<p>"Aren't you glad now, Bo," he said proudly, "that I proposed
this boat business? I have always wanted to travel this
way. I was afraid at first that you might not take to it very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
well, and when that whistle blew last night I could see that
you were frightened. It was unfortunate that I should have had
a fit just then or I might have calmed you. You saw how anxious
I was to go aboard. Of course, in being over brave I made
a slight mistake. I am always that way. All my family are.
One really ought to be less reckless about some things, but
somehow none of my family ever knew what fear was. We&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But just then the boat concluded to land, and the morning
stillness was torn into shreds by its frightful whistle. Horatio
threw up both hands and fell backward on the deck, where
he lay pawing the air wildly. Then he stuffed his paws into his
ears and howled as he kicked with his hind feet. Bo stood over
him and shouted that there was no danger, but his voice made
no sound in that awful thunder. All at once Horatio sprang
up and jammed his head under Bo's arm, trembling like a jellyfish.
Then the noise stopped, and with one or two more hoarse
shouts ceased entirely.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Ratio, come out!" said Bo, trying to stop
laughing.</p>

<p>Horatio felt of his ears a moment to see that they were
still there, while he looked skittishly in the direction of the
dreadful whistle and started violently at the quick snorts of the
escaping steam.</p>

<p>"Bo," he said faintly, "do all boats do that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! Some worse than others. This one isn't very
bad."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Bo, for it is a great drawback to travel where
one is subject to fits as I am. It seems to bring them on. And
it is not kind of you to laugh at my affliction, either, Bosephus,"
he added, for Bo had dropped down on the deck, where he was
rolling and holding his sides.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i026.jpg" width="400" height="338" alt="HE STUFFED HIS PAWS INTO HIS EARS." title="" />
<span class="caption">HE STUFFED HIS PAWS INTO HIS EARS.</span>
</div>

<p>All at once the boy lay perfectly still. Then he sprang up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
with every bit of laugh gone out of his face. His left hand
grasped the outside of his jacket, while with his right hand he
dived down into the inside pocket like mad. The Bear watched
him anxiously.</p>

<p>"What is it, Bo? Have you got one, too?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Horatio!" gasped the boy. "Our money! It's gone!"</p>

<p>"Gone! Gone! Where?"</p>

<p>"Stolen. Some of those niggers did it while we were
asleep!"</p>

<p>The Bear reflected a moment. Then he said thoughtfully:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you suppose, Bo, it was that nice fat one?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder a bit. I saw him watch every penny
I took in last night."</p>

<p>Horatio licked out his tongue eagerly.</p>

<p>"Could I have him if it was?" he asked hungrily.</p>

<p>"Have him! How?" said Bo. Then he shuddered. "Oh! no,
not that way&mdash;of course not. But I'll tell you, Ratio," he added,
"we'll make him believe that you can, and frighten him into
giving up the money."</p>

<p>Horatio frowned.</p>

<p>"I don't like make-believes," he grumbled. "Can't we let
the money go this time and not have any make-believe?"</p>

<p>"Not much&mdash;we want that money right now, before the
boat lands; then we'll go ashore and get out of such a crowd.
Come, Ratio."</p>

<p>No one was stirring on the upper deck as yet, but the crew
was collected below where the second mate was shouting orders
as the boat swung slowly into the bank. They boy and Bear
dashed down the stairs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 462px;">
<img src="images/i027.jpg" width="462" height="500" alt="&quot;OUR MONEY! IT IS GONE!&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;OUR MONEY! IT IS GONE!&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Wait!" shouted Bo to the officer. "Somebody on this
boat last night stole our money, and I want my Bear to find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
him. It won't take but a minute, for he can tell a thief at sight
when he's mad and hungry, and he's mad now, and hungry for
dark meat!" The boy looked straight into the crowd of negroes,
while the Bear growled fiercely and fixed his eye on the fat
darky.</p>

<p>The crew fell back and the fat darky with a howl started to
run.</p>

<p>"That's the one! That's the thief!" shouted Bo, and with
a snarl Horatio bounded away in pursuit. Down the narrow
gangway to the stern of the boat, then in a circle around a lot of
cotton, they ran like mad, the Bear getting closer to the negro
every minute. Then back again to the bow in a straight stretch,
the thief blue with fright and Horatio's eyes shining with
hungry anticipation. The rest of the crew looked on and
cheered. Suddenly, as the fat darky passed Bo, he jerked a
sack from his pocket and flung it behind him.</p>

<p>"Dar's yo' money! Dar's yo' money!" he shouted. "Call
off yo' B'ar!"</p>

<p>But that was not so easy. Bosephus shouted frantically at
Horatio, but he did not seem to hear. His blood was up, and
his taste for dark meat was stronger than his love of money.
As the two came clattering around the second time he was so
close to his prey that with a quick swipe he got quite a piece of
his shirt. With a wild yell the fat fugitive leaped over into the
river and struck out for shore.</p>

<p>Horatio paused. His half open jaws were dripping and his
eyes red and fiery with disappointment. Bo went up to him
gently.</p>

<p>"Come, Ratio," he whispered.</p>

<p>The Bear paid no heed. He was watching his escaped prey,
who had reached the shore and was disappearing in a great
canefield.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come!" Bo whispered again. "We'll go ashore, too."</p>

<p>Horatio wheeled eagerly. The gangplank was being lowered,
and he hurried Bo out on it, so that when it touched the
bank he was all ready to give chase again.</p>

<p>"No, wait; some music first," said Bo. "I have thought of
some new lines for the second part of the tune."</p>

<p>For a moment Horatio hesitated. Then the temptation
of the music was stronger even than his appetite, and, throwing
his violin into position, he began to play. The passengers,
roused by the excitement, had gathered on the upper deck.
The crew coming ashore below paused to listen.</p>

shouted and waved their handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>"Don't go!" they called. "Don't leave us!" But the friends
turned their faces to the East and set out on a broad white road
that led away to the sunrise.</p>

<div class='cap'>DURING the two weeks since they had come to the land
of sugar-cane Horatio and Bosephus had learned some
of the old negro songs of Louisiana and sang them to
their own music. They were doing so now as they
marched along the bank of a quiet bayou, where the blue grass
came to the water's edge and the long Spanish moss from big
live oak trees swung down twenty feet or more till it almost
touched the water. They had had a good day and were going
to camp.</div>

<p>"Bo," said the Bear presently, "we are doing well. We are
making money, Bo."</p>

<p>"Fifty dollars since we left the boat," said the little boy.</p>

<p>"These fat babies&mdash;little darky babies&mdash;are very amusing,
too, Bosephus, don't you think so?" Horatio added, nodding in
the direction of some they were just then passing.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 352px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;THESE LITTLE DARKEY BABIES ARE VERY&mdash;AMUSING.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"I notice that you think so," said Bo, dryly. "If you'll take
my advice, though, you won't show any special fondness for
them. People might not understand your ways, you know, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
besides," he added, with a grin, "I've heard say these darkies
down here are mighty fond of bear meat, and there's such a lot
of them&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't you mention it, Bo; I never dreamed of such a thing
as you are hinting at."</p>

<p>"Well, you said you were dreaming yesterday when we met
that little darky boy, and you nearly tore the jacket off of him
before I could wake you up with a club."</p>

<p>Horatio drew his bow hastily across the strings and began
singing&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>The sun was just setting behind a large, white, old fashioned
sugar house, where the bayou turned, and made it look
like an ancient castle. The little boy sighed. He had never
believed that any country could be so beautiful as this, and he
wanted to stay in it forever. Horatio liked it, too. They had
played and danced at many of the sugar houses, and the Bear had
been given everywhere all the waste sugar he could eat. He
was fond of the green cane also, and was nearly always chewing
a piece when they were not busy with a performance. But the
big fellow had never quite overcome his old savage nature, and
the race on the steamboat had roused it more fiercely than ever.
The fat pickaninnies were a constant temptation to him, and it
had taken all Bo's watchfulness to keep him out of dreadful
mischief. Bo never feared for himself. Horatio loved him and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
had even become afraid of him. It was for Horatio that he
feared, for he knew that death would be sure and swift if one of
the pickaninnies was even so much as scratched, not to mention
anything worse that might happen. Again the little boy
sighed as they turned into a clean grassy place and made ready
for camp.</p>

<p>Long after Bosephus was asleep Horatio sat by the dying
camp fire, thinking. By and by he rose and walked out to the
bank of the bayou and looked toward the sugar house that lay
white in the moonlight, half a mile away. Then he went back
to where Bo was asleep and picked up the violin. Then he laid
it down again, as though he had changed his mind, and slipped
away through the shadows in the direction of the old sugar
house. He said to himself that, as they were going in that direction
and would stop there next day, he might as well see how
the road went and what kind of a place it was. He did not own,
even to himself, that it was the negro cabins and fat pickaninnies
that were in his mind, and that down in his heart was a wicked
and savage purpose. Every little way he paused and seemed
about to turn back, but he kept on. By and by he drew near
the sugar house and saw the double row of whitewashed huts in
the moonlight. It was later than he had supposed and the
crowds of little darkies that were usually playing outside had
gone to bed. He sighed and was about to turn back when suddenly
he saw something capering about near the shed of the
sugar house. He slipped up nearer and a fierce light came into
his eyes. It was a little negro boy doing a hoo-doo dance in the
moonlight.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 310px;">
<img src="images/i033.jpg" width="310" height="475" alt="HE SLIPPED AWAY THROUGH THE SHADOWS." title="" />
<span class="caption">HE SLIPPED AWAY THROUGH THE SHADOWS.</span>
</div>

<p>Suddenly the little fellow turned and saw the Bear glaring
at him. Horatio was between him and the cabins. The boy
gave one wild shriek and dashed through a small open door that
led into the blackness of the sugar house, the Bear following<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
close behind. It was one of the old Creole sugar houses where
the syrup is poured out into open vessels to cool and harden.
The little darky knew his way and Horatio didn't. He stumbled
and fell, and growled and tried to follow the flying shadow
that was skipping and leaping and begging, "Oh, Mars Debbil!
Oh, please, Mars Debbil, lemme go dis time, an' I nevah do so
no mo'. Nevah do no mo' hoo-doo, Mars Debbil; oh, please,
Mars Debbil, lemme go!"</p>

<p>But Horatio was getting closer and closer and in another
moment would seize him. Then, suddenly, something happened.
The Bear stumbled and, half falling, stepped into one
of the big shallow wooden vessels. He felt his hind feet break
through something like crusted ice and sink a foot or more into
a heavy, thick substance below. When he tried to lift them
they only sank deeper. Then he knew what was the matter.
He had stepped into a mass of hardening sugar and was a prisoner!
His forefeet were free, but he dared not struggle with
them for fear of getting them fast, too. The little darky, who
thought the devil had stopped to rest, was huddled together in
a corner not daring to move. Horatio remembered Bo sleeping
safely in their camp and began to weep for his own wickedness.
In the morning men would come with axes and guns.
Why had he not heeded Bo? Half seated on the crusted sugar
he gave himself up to sorrow and despair.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It was early morning when Bo awoke. He was surprised
to see that Horatio was not beside him, for the boy was usually
first awake. He called loudly. Then, as the moments passed
and the Bear did not come, he grew uneasy. Suddenly a terrible
suspicion flashed over him. He sprang to his feet and seizing
the violin that lay beside him set forth on a run in the direction
of the white sugar house. He knew Horatio would go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
there because it was nearest, and he felt certain that something
dreadful had happened. The incident of the day before made
him almost sure of Horatio's errand, and he feared the worst.
No doubt they had caught and killed him by this time, and
what would he do now without his faithful friend?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i034.jpg" width="500" height="383" alt="SUDDENLY THE LITTLE FELLOW TURNED." title="" />
<span class="caption">SUDDENLY THE LITTLE FELLOW TURNED.</span>
</div>

<p>He ran faster and faster. As he drew near the sugar house
he heard a great commotion. For a moment he stopped. If
Horatio had done something terrible and they had caught him
perhaps it would be dangerous to interfere. The next moment
he rushed on. Horatio was his friend and he would save his life
if possible, unless&mdash;&mdash;. He did not think any further, but flew
on. As he dashed into the cane yard he saw crowds gathering
and men running with axes and clubs. Others had guns and
cane knives, and all were crowding toward the big doors of the
sugar house, that were now thrown open. Inside he heard
shouts, mingled with Horatio's fierce growls. His friend was
still alive.</p>

<p>Without pausing he rushed through the doors and
saw a circle of negro men gathered about the big wooden
trough where the Bear was a prisoner, snapping and growling
and trying to get free. The little pickaninny who, in spite of
his fright, had slept all night in the corner, was there, too, and
the men with axes and other weapons had entered with Bo.
There was not a second to be lost.</p>

<p>"Wait!" screamed Bo; "wait!" And tearing through the
astonished crowd he thrust the violin into Horatio's hands.</p>

<p>"Play!" he shouted. "Play for your worthless life!"</p>

<p>Horatio did not need to be told again. He reached for
the violin and bow, and sitting in the now solid sugar struck the
strings wildly.</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"Rooster in de chicken coop, crowin' foh day;<br />
Horses in de stable goin' 'Nay, nay, nay;'<br />
Ducks in de yard goin' 'Quack, quack, quack!'<br />
Guineas in de tree tops, goin' 'Rack-pot-rack!'"<br /></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Horatio fiddled furiously, while Bo shouted and sang and
the crowd joined in. They all knew this song, and as they sang
they forgot all else. Axes and guns and clubs were dropped as
young and old fell into the swing of the music.</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"Keemo, kimo, kilgo, kayro;<br />
Fleero, fliro, flav-o-ray;<br />
Rop strop, periwinkle, little yaller nigger,<br />
Cum a rop strop bottle till de break&mdash;of&mdash;day!"<br />
</div>

<p>You could hear the noise for a mile. They danced and
shouted and sang, and work was forgotten. After a long time,
when they were tired out, Bo took one of the axes and carefully
broke the now solid sugar away from Ratio's feet and set him
free. Then they brought water and washed his hind paws and
he danced for them.</p>

<p>After dinner, when the friends started out on their journey,
the crowd followed them for nearly a mile. When all were gone
Horatio turned to Bo and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am glad you came just as you did, Bo."</p>

<p>"I should rather think you would be," said Bo, grimly.</p>

<p>"Because," continued Horatio, "if you hadn't I might have
damaged some of those fellows, and I know you wouldn't have
liked that, Bosephus." He looked at the little boy very humbly
as he said this, expecting a severe lecture. But the little boy
made no reply, and down in his heart the big Bear at that moment
made a solemn and good resolve.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>SWEET AND SOUR</h3>

<div class='poem2'>
And the song bird nests in the climbing rose&mdash;<br />
And all the girls are beautiful, and milk and honey flows."<br /><br />
</div>


<div class='cap'>HORATIO paused in his playing and looked at Bosephus,
who was ready to sing another stanza.</div>

<p>"Look here, Bo," he said gravely, "that sounds
very pretty and may be very good poetry and true
enough, but I wouldn't get to singing too much about jasmine
and song birds and climbing roses if I were you, and especially
girls. You are only a little boy, and besides, I can't see that
there is any difference in girls, except that some are plump and
some are not, and that isn't any difference to me, now," and the
Bear sighed and strummed on his violin gently.</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw, Ratio! There's lots of difference. Some girls
are yellow and sour as a lemon, while some are as pink and
sweet and blooming as a creole rose"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bosephus," interrupted the Bear gravely, "you've got a
touch of the swamp fever. Let me see your tongue!"</p>

<p>Bo stuck out his tongue.</p>

<p>"My tongue's all right," he grinned. "That kind of fever's
in the heart."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Horatio looked alarmed.</p>

<p>"You must take something for it right away, Bo," he declared.
"I can't have you singing silly songs about jasmine and
cypress and girls in milk and honey. You know we haven't seen
any honey since we left Arkansaw, and I'd travel all the way
back there on foot to rob one good honey tree. I'm getting
tired of so much of this stuff they call sugar and cane and the
like."</p>

<p>"Why they have honey here, Ratio, too. I haven't seen
any bee trees, but I've seen plenty of bees. I suppose they are in
hives&mdash;boxes that people keep for them to live in."</p>

<p>"Where do they have those boxes, Bo?"</p>

<p>"Well, in their yards mostly; generally out by the back
fence."</p>

<p>"Could we rob them?"</p>

<p>"Well, I shouldn't like to try it."</p>

<p>The Bear walked along some distance in silence. The boy
was also thinking and singing softly to himself. He was very
happy. Presently he looked up and saw just ahead, in a field
near the road, a tree loaded with oranges.</p>

<p>"Look, Ratio!" he said. "Don't you wish we had some of
those?"</p>

<p>The Bear looked up and began to lick out his tongue.</p>

<p>"Climb over and get some, Bo," he said eagerly.</p>

<p>"Not much. I haven't forgotten the roasting ears and the
watermelon we got from old man Todd in Arkansaw. We
might go to the house and ask for some.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Bosephus. Watch me!"</p>

<p>He handed Bo the fiddle, and running lightly to the hedge
cleared it at a bound.</p>

<p>"Fine!" shouted Bo.</p>

<p>Horatio, without pausing, hurried over to the tree.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Funny they should leave those oranges so late," thought
the little boy as he watched him.</p>

<p>Swinging himself to the first limb, the Bear shook off a
lot of the fine yellow fruit, and climbing down, gathered in
his arms all he could carry. As he did so there came a loud
barking of dogs, and without looking behind him he started to
run. He dropped a few of the oranges, but kept straight on, the
two huge dogs that had appeared getting closer and closer. As
he reached the hedge he once more made a grand leap, but the
oranges prevented him doing so well as before. His foot caught
in the top branches and he rolled over and over in the dusty road,
the oranges flying in every direction. The dogs behind the
hedge barked and raged.</p>

<p>Horatio rose, dusty and panting, but triumphant.</p>

<p>"You see, Bo," he said, "what it is to be brave. You can fill
your pockets now with these delicious oranges."</p>

<p>He picked up one as he spoke, and brushing off the dust,
bit it in half cheerfully. Then Bo, who was watching him, saw a
strange thing take place. The half orange flew out of the Bear's
mouth as from a popgun, and his face became so distorted that
the boy thought his friend was having a spasm. Suddenly he
whirled, and making a rush at the fallen oranges, began to kick
them in every direction, coughing and spitting every second.
The two dogs looking over the hedge stopped barking to enjoy
the fun. One of the oranges rolled to Bo's feet. He picked it
up and smelled it. Then rubbing it on his coat he bit into it. It
was not a large bite, but it was enough. The tears rolled from
his eyes and every tooth in his head jumped. Such a mixture of
stinging sour and bitter he had never dreamed of. It grabbed
him by the throat and shook him until his bones cracked. The
top of his head seemed coming loose, and his ears fairly snapped.
Then he realized what Horatio must be suffering, and laughed in
spite of himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">FLEW OUT OF HIS MOUTH AS FROM A POP GUN.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"They are mock oranges, Ratio," he shouted, "and they
are mocking us for stealing them!"</p>

<p>Horatio had seated himself by the roadside and was snorting
and clawing at his tongue.</p>

<p>"I must have some honey, Bo," he said, "to take away that
dreadful taste. You must find me some honey, Bo."</p>

<p>"You see, Ratio," said the little boy, "it doesn't pay to take
things."</p>

<p>"Bosephus," said the Bear, "a man who will plant a tree like
that so near the road deceives wilfully and should be punished."</p>

<p>They walked along slowly, the two dogs barking after
them from behind the hedge.</p>

<p>Just beyond the next bend in the road a beautiful plantation
came into view. They turned into the cane yard and immediately
the workhands surrounded them. Horatio felt better
by this time, and they began a performance. First Bo sang
and then Horatio gave a gymnastic exhibition. Then at last
Bo sang a closing verse as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="music/bear3.mid"><img src="images/music3.png" width="400" height="68" alt="Music 3rd Line" title="Music 3rd Line" /></a>
</div>

<div class='poem2'>
"Now our little show is ended, and we hope you think it splendid,<br />
And we trust we've not offended or displeased you anywhere,<br />
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="music/bear3.mid"><img src="images/music4.png" width="400" height="72" alt="Music 4th Line" title="Music 4th Line" /></a>
</div>

<div class='poem2'>
You have paid us to be funny, and we thank you for the money,<br />
But I'd like a little honey for the Old&mdash;Black&mdash;Bear.<br />
</div>

<p>Horatio smiled when he heard this, and the planter who
was listening sent one of the servants to the house. He came
out soon with a piece of fresh honey on a plate. He offered it
to Horatio, who handed Bo the violin, and seizing the plate,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
swallowed the honey at one gulp. This made the crowd shout
and laugh, and then Bo shook hands with the planter and said
good-bye, and all the darkies came up and wanted to shake
hands, too. When he had shaken hands all around the little boy
turned to look for Horatio. He was nowhere in sight. The
others had not noticed him slip away.</p>

<p>Bo was troubled. When Horatio disappeared like that it
meant mischief. He had promised reform as to pickaninnies,
but Bo was never quite sure. He was about to ask the people to
run in every direction in search of his comrade when there was
a sudden commotion in the back door yard, and a moment later
a black figure dashed through the gate with something under
its arm. It was Horatio! The crowd of darkies took one look
and scattered. The thing under Horatio's arm was a square,
box looking affair, and out of it was streaming a black, living
cloud.</p>

<p>"Bees!" shouted the people as they fled. "Bees! Bees!"</p>

<p>Bo understood instantly. The taste of honey had made
Horatio greedy for more. He had gone in search of it and returned
with hive and all. There was a clump of tall weeds just
behind the little boy, and he dropped down into them. They hid
him from view, and none too soon, for the Bear dashed past,
snorting and striking at the swarm of stingers that not only
covered him, but fiercely attacked everything in sight. Howls
began to come from some of the hands that had failed to find
shelter in time, and Bo, peeping out between the weeds, saw
half a dozen darkies frantically trying to open the big door of
the sugar house, which had been hastily closed by those within,
while the angry bees were pelting furiously at the unfortunates.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i038.jpg" width="450" height="495" alt="THE BEAR DASHED PAST, SNORTING." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE BEAR DASHED PAST, SNORTING.</span>
</div>

<p>As for Horatio, he was coated with bees that were trying to
sting through his thick fur. He did not mind them at first, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
presently they began to get near his eyes. With a snarl he
dropped the hive and began to paw and strike with both hands.
Then they swarmed about him worse than ever, and, half blinded,
he began to run around and around with no regard as to direction.
Every darky in sight fled like the wind. Some of
them ran out of the gate and down the road, and without seeing
them, perhaps, the Bear suddenly leaped the fence and set
out in the same direction. Glancing back, they saw him coming
and began to shriek and scatter into the fields.</p>

<p>Bo waited some minutes; then, noticing that the maddened
insects were no longer buzzing viciously over him, he crept out
and followed. He still held the violin and was glad enough to
get away from the plantation. The bees had followed the fugitive,
and the boy kept far enough behind to be out of danger.
By and by he met bees coming back, but perhaps they were tired
or thought he belonged to another crowd, for they did not molest
him. A mile further on he found Horatio sitting in the road
rocking and groaning and throwing dust on himself. His eyes
and nose were swollen in great knots, and his ears were each
puffed up like little balloons. The bees had left him, but his
sorrow was at its height.</p>

<p>"Hello, Ratio! Having fun all alone?" asked Bo as he came
up.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bo, this has been an awful day!" was the wailing reply.
"First those terrible oranges and then these millions and
millions of murderous bees. And now I am blind, Bo, and dying.
Tell me, Bo, how do I look?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you look all right. Your nose looks like a big potato
and your ears like two little ones. I can't tell you how your
eyes are, for they don't show, but your whole skin looks as if
it had been stuffed full of apples and put on in a hurry."</p>

<p>"Bo," said Horatio meekly, "did you bring the fiddle?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, yes; I thought it might happen that we'd need it
again."</p>

<p>Horatio put out his paw for it. The boy gave it to him and
he ran the bow gently over the strings.</p>

<p>"Sing, Bo," he pleaded. "Sing that song about jasmine
and cypress and climbing roses. It will soothe me. Sing about
girls, too, if you want to, but leave out the oranges, Bo, and put
in something else besides honey in the last line."</p>

<p>"Ratio," said Bo, "you've got a touch of the swamp fever.
Let me see your tongue!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>IN JAIL AT LAST</h3>

<div class='poem2'>
"Oh, the sky is blue and the sun is high,<br />
And the days roll 'round, and the weeks go by&mdash;&mdash;"<br /><br />
</div>


<div class='cap'>BO," interrupted Horatio, softly; "what's that over
there on the bank that looks like a man all in a
wad?"</div>

<p>The little boy was singing along through the
sweet Louisiana afternoon, putting into his song whatever came
into his head:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"And I turn, and I look, and what do I see?<br />
Someone's left his bundle by a live oak tree."<br />
</div>

<p>"What do you suppose is in that bundle, Bo?" asked the
Bear, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. Old clothes, from the looks of it. The
owner isn't far off.</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"When a coat and vest and hat, and pair of trousers you espy,<br />
You can bet your bottom dollar there's a man close by."<br />
</div>

<p>Horatio looked in every direction. Then he walked over
to the clothes.</p>

<p>"Why," said Bo, following; "I guess somebody's taking a
swim. Come on, Ratio. Remember the honey and the oranges."</p>

<p>But the Bear was curious. He picked up the hat and set it
on his head. Bo laughed lazily. Then Horatio laid down his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
violin and slipped one arm into the waistcoat, trying vainly to
reach with the other. Bo good-naturedly helped him. The
little boy felt in the humor for fun, and Horatio looked too comical.</p>

<p>"Better not put on the coat," said Bo. "It might not be
big enough and if you tore it the owner would make us pay
for it."</p>

<p>But Horatio was excited.</p>

<p>"Hurry, Bo! Help me on with it. How do I look, Bo?
I think I'll dress this way all the time, hereafter. Is my hat becoming,
Bo?"</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"Oh, there was an Old Bear in a hat and a coat,"<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>sang Bo, but he got no further, for suddenly close by there
was a loud yell, and without pausing to look behind Horatio
made a wild dash in the other direction, followed by the little
boy. Glancing back as they ran, Bo saw that they were pursued
by a tall white man. He had paused only a second to slip
on his boots and trousers, and was coming after them full speed.
In one hand he carried a revolver, in the other Horatio's violin.</div>

<p>"Shed 'em!" he shouted. "Shed them clothes or I'll shoot!"</p>

<p>"Shed 'em!" echoed Bo. "Shed 'em, Horatio!"</p>

<p>The bear slipped off the coat and flung it behind him.</p>

<p>"Shed 'em!" shouted the man again, and the waistcoat
followed.</p>

<p>"I won't give up the hat, Bo!" panted Horatio.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 428px;">
<img src="images/i040.jpg" width="428" height="450" alt="&quot;HOW DO I LOOK, BO?&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;HOW DO I LOOK, BO?&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>But Horatio was mistaken, for at that instant the world
beneath his feet suddenly opened and he disappeared. Before
the boy could check himself he plunged after the Bear and was
struggling in the deep waters of a bayou that came to a level
with the bank and was covered thickly and concealed by fallen
leaves. Rising to the surface he found Horatio clinging to a
fallen tree and the man, who had now overtaken them, holding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
out a limb, which the little boy gladly seized. The hat had been
already rescued.</p>

<p>"Well, you're a nice pair!" said their captor. "To run away
with a man's clothes and then go headlong into the bayou and
get his hat all wet! I'm glad you didn't have that fiddle, or you'd
a-ruined it. I've bin wantin' a good fiddle a long time, an' this
here looks like a good one. Come out o' that, now, an' we'll
take a walk up toward the jail. I happen to be constable of this
here community."</p>

<p>Bo groaned as he was dragged to shore. He did not mind
the wetting, for the weather was warm, but now they had lost
the violin and would be taken to jail. Of course they would
lose all their money. Perhaps Horatio would be killed. The
Bear only blinked and shook himself when he had been also
towed to the bank and had scrambled out.</p>

<p>"I hope you won't take us to jail, sir," said Bo. "My Bear
was mischievous, but he didn't mean any harm, and I have a little
money I'll give you if you'll return us the violin and let us
go."</p>

<p>"You come along with me!" answered the man, sternly.
"It'll take more money than you've got to pay your fine, an' as
fer that chap, we don't want no bears roamin' loose aroun' here.
March on ahead there, an' don't try none o' your tricks."</p>

<p>The constable cocked his revolver, and boy and Bear hurriedly
started in the direction of the village that showed above
the trees about a mile further on.</p>

<p>Bo was afraid to speak to their captor again, and as he never
talked with Horatio except when they were alone, they marched
along disconsolately and in silence. Now and then the man
strummed on the violin and chuckled to himself.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 455px;">
<img src="images/i041.jpg" width="455" height="500" alt="&quot;SHED THEM CLOTHES OR I&#39;LL SHOOT!&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;SHED THEM CLOTHES OR I&#39;LL SHOOT!&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>When they got to the village everybody came out to look
at them. The man called out his story as they went along, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the people laughed and jeered. Heretofore the friends had entered
Louisiana villages in triumph. Now, for the first time,
they came dishonored and disgraced. Poor Horatio looked
very downcast. He knew that he was to blame for it all.</p>

<p>When they got to the court room they found that the
Justice of the Peace was away fishing, so they were lodged in
jail for the night. It was only a little one room affair, with two
small iron-barred windows, quite high from the ground. Boys
climbed up and looked through these windows and threw stones
and coal in at Horatio, who huddled in a corner. By and by the
officer came with a plate of supper for Bo. He drove the boys
away and left the friends together. There was no supper for
the Bear, so the little boy divided with him.</p>

<p>"Bo," said Horatio, tearfully, "it was my fault. They'll let
you go, and, and&mdash;I hope they'll give you my skin, Bo."</p>

<p>Then they went to sleep.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Early next morning there was a crowd around the jail. The
Justice had returned and the people wanted to see the fun. The
friends were hustled into court by the constable, the crowd
stepping back to let Horatio pass. The justice was rather a
young man and had a good-natured face, which made Bo more
hopeful. But when they heard the constable make his charge
against them, both lost heart. They were accused of stealing
and damages and a lot of other things that they could not understand.
The Justice listened and then turned to the prisoners.</p>

<p>"What have you to say for yourselves?" he asked, looking
straight at Bo. At first the little boy tried to speak and could
not. The court room was still&mdash;every one waiting to hear what
he was about to say. All at once an idea came to him.</p>

<p>"Please, sir," he trembled, "if you will let my Bear have
the violin we will plead our case together."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"What violin? What does the boy mean?" asked the Justice,
turning to the constable.</p>

<p>"Oh, an ole fiddle they dropped when they took my clothes.
I lef' it down 't the house this morning."</p>

<p>Bo's heart sank. It was their only chance. He was about
to give up when suddenly there came another gleam of hope,
though very faint. Wheeling quickly toward the sorrow stricken
Bear he shouted:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Perform for them, Horatio! Perform!"</p>

<p>The words acted on Horatio like a shock of electricity. He
straightened up with a snort that caused the crowd to fall back,
knocking each other over like dominos. Then he made a bound
into the open space and stood on his head. Then with a spring
backward he landed on his feet, and waved a bow to the Justice!
Another bound and he was walking on his hands and then, after
another bow to the Court, he turned a series of somersaults so
rapidly that he looked like a great wheel! When he landed on
his feet this time, and bowed once more to the Court, the crowd
broke out into a mighty cheer of applause.</p>

<p>"Order!" shouted the Justice. "Order!"</p>

<p>It grew still, and the little boy looked at the Court anxiously.</p>

<p>"Please, Your Honor," he said humbly, "that's our case."</p>

<p>"Case!" roared the Justice. "Well, I should say that was a
case of fits and revolution."</p>

<p>At this the crowd cheered again until they were rapped to
order by the Court.</p>

<p>"I sentence you," he said solemnly, and looking sternly at
Horatio, "to sudden and disagreeable death!"</p>

<p>He paused, and Horatio staggered against Bo, who was
very pale.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i042.jpg" width="500" height="211" alt="A CASE OF FITS AND REVOLUTION." title="" />
<span class="caption">A CASE OF FITS AND REVOLUTION.</span>
</div>

<p>"To sudden death," continued the Court, "if I catch you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
running off and falling in the water with any more of my officer's
clothes. And I now fine you, for the first offense, a performance
on the common for the whole town! Court is adjourned!
Show begins at once! Constable, bring that fiddle!"</p>

<p>With a wild shout the people poured outside. Many
scrambled over each other to get near Bosephus and the wonderful
Bear, and when the violin was brought and the show had
begun every soul in the village was gathered on the common.</p>

<p>That night, when all was over, the little boy and the Bear
were the guests of the Justice, who owned a fine plantation adjoining
the village. During the evening he had a long talk with
Bo, and seemed greatly impressed with the little boy's natural
ability and shrewdness. When they parted next morning he
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Remember, if you ever feel like giving up travel, come
back here and I'll send you to school and college and make a
man of you."</p>

<p>"I'll remember," said Bo, as they shook hands. A crowd
had gathered to see the travellers off. The constable was
among them, and as they disappeared around a bend in the road
he waved and shouted with the rest.</p>

<p>"Bosephus," said Horatio gravely, "I hope you don't think
of deserting me. Remember how many close places I have
helped you out of. This last was a little the closest of all, Bosephus,
and I shudder to think where you might have been today
if it had not been for me."</p>

<p>"That's so," said the little boy solemnly. "I don't suppose
they'd have even given me your skin, Ratio."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>AN AFTERNOON'S FISHING</h3>

<div class='poem2'>
"Sitting on a bank where the bull frogs dream&mdash;<br />
Sitting on the shore of a deep, deep stream&mdash;<br />
Sitting on a log and waiting for a bite&mdash;<br />
Bound to catch our supper, if we fish&mdash;all&mdash;night."<br /><br />
</div>


<div class='cap'>THE little boy was holding a long cane pole that he
had cut as they came along, on the small end of
which he had fastened a hook and line, baited with a
lively worm. The Bear was leaning back against
a tree and watching him lazily.</div>

<p>"Bo," said he presently, "I shouldn't wonder if that singing
of yours scared the fish all away."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't say that to you, Ratio. I know if you'd wake
up and take the fiddle and play some they'd walk right out on
the bank."</p>

<p>The Bear laughed sleepily. He was in a comfortable position
and the warm afternoon sun was soothing. He hummed
some negro lines he had heard:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"When yo' wan' to ketch fish yo' mus' jes' set an' wait&mdash;<br />
When yo' wan' to ketch fish yo' must spit on yo' bait&mdash;<br />
When yo' wan' to ketch fish yo' mus' git across de tide,<br />
For dey's alw'ys bettah fishin' on de oth&mdash;ah&mdash;side."<br />
</div>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder if you were right, Ratio," assented Bo,
anxiously. "It does look better over there, only there's no way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
to get across except this slippery looking, rotten old log, and I
don't feel much like trying that."</p>

<p>"Walk out on it a little way, Bo," said Horatio, getting interested,
"and throw your line over there by that cypress snag.
That looks like a good place."</p>

<p>Bosephus rose cautiously, and, balancing himself with the
long cane pole, edged his way a few inches at a time toward the
middle of the stream, pausing every little way to be sure that
the log showed no sign of yielding. He could swim, but he did
not wish for a wetting, and besides there were a good many alligators
in these Louisiana waters and some very fierce snapping
turtles. He had heard the negroes say that alligators were particularly
fond of boys, and that snapping turtles never let go till
it thundered. He had no wish to furnish supper for an alligator
and there were no signs of a thunder storm. Hence he advanced
with great prudence. When he had nearly reached the
centre Horatio called to him.</p>

<p>"Try it from there, Bo! Your line's long enough to
reach!"</p>

<p>The little boy steadied himself by a limb that projected
from the log and swung his line in the direction the Bear had
indicated. Then he waited, holding his breath almost, and watching
his float, which lay silently on the water. Horatio was
watching, too, with half closed eyes, and now and then giving
instructions.</p>

<p>"Pull it a little more to the right, Bo&mdash;nearer that root,"
he whispered.</p>

<p>Bosephus obeyed, but the float still lay silently on the
water.</p>

<p>"Draw it a little toward you, Bo; sometimes when they
think its going away they make a rush for it."</p>

<p>Again the little boy did as directed, but without result.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lift out your bait and see if it's all right. Now fling it
a little further toward the bank."</p>

<p>Bo lifted out the bait, which was still lively and untouched,
and flung it far over toward the other shore. Then he waited
in silence once more, but there was no sign of even so much
as a nibble.</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw, Ratio!" he said at last impatiently. "I don't
believe you know anything about fishing. Either that or there
are no fish in here&mdash;one of the two."</p>

<p>He had turned his head toward the Bear as he spoke and
was not looking at his float. All at once the Bear sat straight
up, pointing at the water.</p>

<p>"Your cork's gone!" he shouted. "You've got one! Pull,
Bo, pull!"</p>

<p>The little boy turned so quickly that he almost lost his balance
and could not immediately obey. Horatio was wild with
excitement.</p>

<p>"Why don't you pull?" he howled. "Do you expect him to
climb up your pole? Are you waiting for him to make his toilet
before he appears? Well, talk about fishermen!"</p>

<p>Bosephus was struggling madly to follow instructions. He
was holding to the dead limb like grim death and pulling fiercely
at the pole with one hand. The fish must be a large one, for it
swung furiously from side to side, but could not be brought to
the surface. Horatio on the bank was still shouting and dancing
violently.</p>

<p>"You'll lose him!" he yelled; "you'll never in the world land
him that way. You ought to go fishing for tin fish in a tub!
Just let me out there; I'll show you how to fish!" and Horatio
made a rush toward the log on which Bo was standing.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 408px;">
<img src="images/i043.jpg" width="408" height="500" alt="&quot;PULL, BO, PULL!&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;PULL, BO, PULL!&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Go back! Go back!" screamed the little boy. "It won't
hold us both!" But the Bear was too much excited by this time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
to heed any caution. He hurried to the centre of the log and
seizing the pole from Bo's hand gave a fierce pull. The fish
swung clear of the water and far out on the bank, but the strain
on their support was too great. There was a loud cracking
sound, and before they knew what had happened both were
struggling in the water.</p>

<p>"Help! Help!" howled Horatio. "I'm drowning!"</p>

<p>"Hold to the end of the log!" shouted Bo. "I'll swim
ashore and tow you in with the pole!"</p>

<p>He struck out as he spoke and in a few strokes was near
enough to seize some bushes that overhung the water. Suddenly
he heard Horatio give forth a scream so wild that he
whirled about to look. Then he saw something that made him
turn cold. In a half circle, a few feet away from where Horatio
was clinging to the end of the broken log for dear life, there had
risen from the water a number of long, black, ugly heads. A
drove of alligators!</p>

<p>"Bo! Bo!" shrieked the wretched Bear. "They're after
me! They'll eat me alive&mdash;skin and all! Save me! Save me!"</p>

<p>The little boy swung himself to the shore and dashed up the
bank. His first thought had been to seize the fishing pole and
with it to drag Horatio to safety. But at that instant his eye
fell on the violin. He had learned to play very well himself during
the last few weeks and he remembered the night of the
panther dance in the Arkansaw woods. He snatched up the instrument
and struck the bow across the strings.</p>

<p>"Sing, Horatio!" he shouted. "It's your turn to sing!" and
Bosephus broke out into a song that after the first line the
Bear joined as if he never expected to sing again on earth.</p>

And the Bear was glad to see 'em, and he wanted them to stay,<br />
And he sang a song to please 'em so they wouldn't go away."<br />
</div>

<p>As the music rolled out on the water there rose to the surface
another half circle of dark objects. The Bear shut his eyes
and his voice grew faint. They were snapping turtles.</p>

<p>"Stop, Bo!" he wailed. "It's no use. It only brings more
of 'em, and new kinds."</p>

<p>"No, no; go on," whispered Bo, who had crept down quite
to the water's edge. "Now&mdash;ready! sing!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="music/bear3.mid"><img src="images/music3.png" width="400" height="68" alt="Music 3rd Line" title="Music 3rd Line" /></a>

</div>

<p>New arrivals appeared constantly until the water and logs
and stumps by the water's edge were alive with listening creatures.
Still remembering the panther dance the boy called in a
whisper to Horatio:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Softly now; sing it again."</p>

<p>They repeated the song, letting their voices and music
gradually blend into the whispering of the trees. Bo sang with
closed eyes, but the watching Bear saw the listening circle of
heads sink lower and lower so gently that he could not be sure
when the water had closed over them. From roots and logs and
stumps dark forms slid noiselessly into the stream and disappeared.
The music died away and ceased. Horatio looked at
the little boy eagerly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>"Quick, the pole, Bo," he called softly. "They're all gone."</p>

<p>A moment later he was holding on to the cane pole with
teeth and claws and being towed to shore. As he marched up
the bank he picked up the large fish that was still flopping at the
end of the line.</p>

<p>"Very fine, Bosephus," he said, holding it up. "You
wouldn't have had that fish for supper if it hadn't been for me,
Bosephus."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>THE ROAD HOME</h3>

<div class='poem2'>
"Going back to Arkansaw as fast as we can go&mdash;<br />
Never mind the winter time&mdash;never mind the snow,<br />
For the weather's not so chilly as the Louisiana law,<br />
And we'll feel a good deal safer in the Ar&mdash;kan&mdash;saw."<br /><br />
</div>


<div class='cap'>IT had happened in this way. The afternoon before
Christmas had come and the little boy and the Bear
had been talking over a Christmas dinner for the
next day.</div>

<p>"Bosephus," Horatio had said, "we must have something
extra. I should like a real old-fashioned dinner. One such as
I used to have; but, of course, that is all over now." And there
was an untamed, regretful look in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Ratio," said Bo, "we have got a lot of money&mdash;nearly
two hundred dollars. We can afford to have something good.
I will buy a duck and a turkey and maybe some pies. We'll
take a holiday and eat from morning till night if we feel like it."</p>

<p>The Bear smiled at this thought and touched the strings
of the violin.</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"Oh, we'll buy a tender turkey, and we'll buy a youthful duck,<br />
And some pies, perhaps, and cookies, and some doughnuts, just for luck,<br />
And we'll take our Christmas dinner where the balmy breezes stray,<br />
And we'll spread it in the sunshine and we'll eat&mdash;all&mdash;day."<br />
</div>

<p>Suddenly he paused in his singing and listened. They
were coming out into an open space and there was a sound of
a voice speaking. Somebody was talking in a foreign language
that Bo did not understand, but the Bear trembled with eagerness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bo," he whispered, "that's Italian. That's the way my
first teacher talked. The one that abused me&mdash;and died."</p>

<p>The Bear licked out his tongue fiercely at this memory and
pushed forward into the open, the little boy following. As
they stepped out where they could see, Bosephus uttered an
exclamation and Horatio a snort of surprise. By the roadside
sat a dark-browed, villainous-looking Italian and before him
stood a miserable half-starved bear cub, which he was trying to
teach. He would speak a few words to it and then beat it
fiercely with a heavy stick. The little bear cowered and trembled
and could not obey. Horatio gave a low dangerous growl
as Bo held him back. The Italian turned and saw them.</p>

<p>"What are you beating that cub for?" asked Bo, sternly.</p>

<p>The Italian looked at him evilly.</p>

<p>"Maka him grow an' dance an' playa fid, lika yo' bear," he
said, sullenly. "Soa he maka da mun'."</p>

<p>"That won't do it. You can teach him better with kindness.
Throw that stick away. Aren't you ashamed of yourself."</p>

<p>"Minda yo' own biz," was the insolent reply.</p>

<p>The little boy saw that it would not be safe to stay there
any longer. The cub was whining pitifully and Horatio was
becoming furious. He turned away, the Bear following reluctantly.
When they had gone perhaps a half a mile Horatio
paused.</p>

<p>"Let's camp here," he said. "This is a nice place and I'm
tired."</p>

<p>Bosephus was tired, too. The day before Christmas with
its merry preparation had been a big day among the plantations
and the friends had reaped a harvest.</p>

<p>"All right, Ratio," he said, and they made preparations
for the night, though it was still quite early.</p>

</div>

<p>"Bo," said the Bear, reflectively, "Christmas always reminds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
me of when I was a little cub like that poor little fellow
we saw back yonder. I was a Christmas present&mdash;by accident."</p>

<p>"A Christmas present by accident! How was that?"</p>

<p>"It was this way. I was always brave and adventurous,
as you know. My folks lived in a very large tree and were all
asleep for the winter except me. I stayed awake so as to run
away and see the world. Well, I started out and I travelled
and I travelled. It was all woods and I lost my way. By and
by I got very tired and climbed up into a thick evergreen tree
to rest. I suppose I went to sleep and some men who were
out hunting for a Christmas tree must have picked out mine
and tied the limbs together tight with cords and cut it down.
Then I suppose they must have carried me home and set the
tree up in its place and untied the cords, for the first I knew
I was tumbling out on to a carpet in a big room, and a lot of
children were screaming and running in every direction. I was
bigger and some fatter than that cub we saw with the Italian&mdash;poor
little fellow.</p>

<p>"I'd like to talk to that villain about five minutes alone,"
continued Horatio, grimly. "I'm sure I could interest him. I'd
tell him about the man that used to beat me, and I might give
him an imitation of what happened to him," and the big fellow
rose and walked back and forth in excitement.</p>

<p>"But go on with your story, Ratio; what happened to you
after you fell out of the Christmas tree?"</p>

<p>"Oh! the children tamed me and fed me till I got so big
they were afraid of me, and then I ate up some young pigs and a
calf and went away."</p>

<p>"You ran away, you mean. What happened then?"</p>

<p>"Well, I went quite a distance and fell in with a circus. I
learned to dance there and stayed with them a while. But one
day the young ibex came in to see me and they couldn't find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
anything of him after that except his horns, and seemed suspicious
of me, so I went away again."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ratio!"</p>

<p>"Yes; I travelled and changed about a good deal till by and
by I fell in with the Italian who promised to teach me to play
the violin, and he did teach me some, as you know, but he
wasn't kind to me, so I&mdash;I wore mourning for him a while, and
went away again. Then I met up with you, and you taught me
the second part of our tune, and we went into partnership and
I reformed, and we've been together ever since. We've been in
some pretty close places together, Bosephus, but I've always
managed to pull us through safely, and you have behaved very
nobly, too, at times, Bosephus&mdash;very nobly, indeed."</p>

<p>"Are you sure you have reformed, Horatio?"</p>

<p>Horatio swung the violin to his shoulder and drew the bow
across the strings. Then he sang softly:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"with my money all the same."<br />
</div>

<p>The little boy laughed. The Bear seemed to have forgotten
the cruel Italian and was in his usual good humor.</p>

<p>"I think I can trust you, Horatio; I'm not a bit afraid of
you."</p>

<p>"Bo," said Ratio, speaking suddenly, "speaking of Christmas
trees, we ought to have one. I saw a beautiful one up the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
stream yonder. I think I'll go and get it, if you'll look after
the supper while I'm gone."</p>

<p>"Why, yes, Horatio, only don't be long about it."</p>

<p>Horatio struck the violin with a long vigorous sweep.</p>

</div>

<p>Bo laughed again. He had never seen Horatio in a better
humor.</p>

<p>"If you eat too much pie it may send you to your doom&mdash;doom&mdash;doom,"
he said. "Hurry back, now, with that tree. You
can pull it up by the roots and we'll plant it again here. Then
it will keep right on growing."</p>

<p>The bear set out up the stream and the boy busied himself
with building a fire and taking out of a sack a lot of food that
had been given them by the planters during the afternoon. He
spread this on the leaves and moss and then sat down and gazed
into the bright blaze. It was pleasant and warm and he was
quite tired. After a while he wondered sleepily why the Bear
didn't come back, and concluded he was having a hard time
pulling up the tree. Then he began thinking of all the adventures
they had had together and of the little cub bear and the
cruel Italian.</p>

<p>"I was tempted to let Horatio at him," he thought. "A
man like that should be beaten until he couldn't stand. That
poor little creature! How wistfully he looked at us. He kept
whining&mdash;perhaps he was telling Ratio something."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>The little boy's head nodded forward now and then and
presently he slept. He slept soundly and the moments flew by
unheeded. He was having a long dream about old man Todd
and the girls and the two candy hearts, when suddenly there
arose close at hand such a commotion, such a mingling of excited
language, fierce snarls and crashing of brush that the little
boy leaped to his feet wildly.</p>

<p>"Ratio!" he shouted. "Ratio! where are you?"</p>

<p>The only answer was the redoubled fury of the furious uproar,
which Bo now located at the edge of the road but a few
feet away. He tore through the brush hastily in that direction.
As he reached the spot the turmoil ceased and he heard the
sound of running feet. Dashing through into the road he beheld
a strange sight. A half-naked man was disappearing over
the hill just beyond, and Horatio, holding some rags of clothing
in one hand and the paw of the little bear in the other, was looking
after him hungrily, as if about to pursue. Before him lay
the Christmas tree badly broken and bruised.</p>

<p>"Ratio!" exclaimed Bo. "What have you been doing?"</p>

<p>The Bear looked at Bo sheepishly.</p>

<p>"I went for the Christmas tree," he said, meekly, "and just
as I was coming back the Italian man came along, and he was
beating this little chap, and so I tried the Christmas tree on
him to see how he liked it. Then we got into an argument, and
when he went away he left the cub with us and didn't take all
of his clothing."</p>

<p>The little boy reflected a moment.</p>

<p>"I hope, Horatio," he said, gravely, "you did not mean to
break your agreement about, you know&mdash;about dinners."</p>

<p>"I didn't, Bo; honest, I didn't. I wouldn't touch that fellow
if I was starving. But I did pretty nearly break his neck,
Bo, and I'm glad of it!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">GOING BACK TO ARKANSAW.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ratio," said Bo, solemnly, "it's very wrong, I suppose;
very wrong, indeed; but I'm glad, too. Only we've got to
postpone that Christmas dinner. That fellow will be back here
to-night with officers, and we've had all the law we want. We
start for Arkansaw in five minutes. A bite of supper and then
right about! ready! march!"</p>

<p>And this was the reason Horatio and Bosephus and the
little cub bear were travelling swiftly northward in spite of the
winter weather that was not yet over. The cub was small and
weak and Horatio, who loved him and sometimes called him
"little brother," often carried him. They gave no performances,
but only pushed forward, mile after mile, chanting solemnly:&mdash;</p>

"Going back to Arkansaw as fast as we can go&mdash;<br />

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>THE BEAR COLONY AT LAST. THE PARTING<br />
OF BOSEPHUS AND HORATIO</h3>

<div class='poem2'>
"Oh, the wind blows fair and the snow is gone<br />
In the Arkansaw when the spring comes on.<br />
Oh, the sun shines warm and the wind blows fair,<br />
For the boy and the cub and the Old&mdash;Black&mdash;Bear."<br /><br />
</div>


<div class='cap'>SO sang Bosephus and Horatio as they sat side by
side in the doorway of a deserted lumberman's cabin
in the depths of an Arkansaw forest. The cub rescued
from the brutal Italian and brought with them
on their hasty journey out of Louisiana, stood a few feet away
watching them intently. Now and then he made an awkward
attempt at dancing, which caused Bosephus and Horatio to stop
their music and laugh. He had grown fat and saucy with good
treatment, and seemed to enjoy the amusement he caused. At
a little distance behind him, some seated and some standing, and
all enjoying the entertainment, were seven other bears of various
sizes. The colony so long planned by Horatio and Bosephus
was established.</div>

<p>The long journey out of Louisiana had been made rapidly
and with no delays. Though midwinter when begun, the weather
had been beautiful at the start, and there had been few storms
and but little cold since. The cub had gradually confided his
story to Horatio, who loved him and continued to call him affectionately
"little brother." He had been captured in a very
deep woods, he said, by hunters, who sold him to the Italian.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
He did not know where these woods were, but as the friends
crossed the Louisiana line and entered lower Arkansaw he grew
more and more excited every day, for he declared these were
so like his native woods that he could almost hear his mother's
voice crooning the evening lullaby. Soon after, they came one
evening upon a deserted lumberman's camp and took possession
of the one cabin that still remained. It was a good shelter and
there was a stream with fine fish in it close at hand. But when
the friends awoke next morning the little bear was gone.</p>

<p>They were very sorry, for they had grown much attached
to the little chap and he had seemed to be fond of them also. It
was very lonely in the deep forest without him. Horatio sighed.</p>

<p>"He didn't appreciate us, Bo," he said, sadly. "He's gone
back to be a wild bear. He never got the taste of men&mdash;tastes,
I mean, and I suppose these woods made him homesick. They
are like my old woods, too, and I get homesick sometimes&mdash;even
now." Then the boy and the Bear went to the brook to
fish and the day passed gloomily.</p>

<p>But that night, when Bo had built a fire in the big fireplace
which almost filled one end of the cabin, and was cooking the
fish, there came a muffled scratching sound at the door. Horatio
sprang to his feet instantly.</p>

<p>"That's Cub," he said, excitedly.</p>

<p>The boy ran to the door and opened it. Sure enough, the
little cub stood before him, and out of the darkness behind
gleamed seven other pairs of eyes. The boy was brave, but as
he saw that row of fiery orbs he felt his flesh creep and his hair
began to prickle.</p>

<p>"Horatio!" he called, softly, "come quick."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption">THE POOR BEAR GAVE WAY COMPLETELY.</span>
</div>

<p>The Bear was already by his side, and a moment later with
the cub stepped out into the night. Then Bosephus heard low
growls followed by a strange commotion, which he at first took<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
to be the sound of fighting. Suddenly Horatio ran to him in
great excitement.</p>

<p>"Bo, Bo!" he exclaimed, "it's my family! and, oh, Bosephus,
it's Cub's family, too! We're really brothers, and we didn't
know it!" Then he ran back into the dark and presently returned
with the cub and the seven other bears, following. The newcomers
stared and blinked at the little boy as they entered the
lighted cabin and then withdrew to a darker corner, where they
sat silently regarding everything that passed, like strangers
from the country. The cub sat with them and whispered softly,
in the bear tongue, and Horatio now and then went over, too,
and no doubt told them marvellous tales of his strange adventures.
Late that night all lay down to sleep&mdash;the little boy in
the arms of his faithful friend.</p>

<p>And so the Bear Colony had begun, even sooner than Bo
and Ratio had expected, and they had given up all notion of
travelling any further. The lumber camp was deserted for good
by the woodcutters, for the largest trees had been cut out and
taken away long before. The cabin was headquarters&mdash;Bosephus
was president, Horatio prime minister, and the cub, because
of his adventures and slight educational advancement, was
chief assistant. Early spring was upon the land, and the woods
were beginning to be sweet with song and blossom. Bosephus
was almost afraid at first that, with the native woods and the renewal
of home ties, Horatio might return more or less to his
savage instincts, but he became gentler and more docile than
ever. His place as prime minister and chief instructor made him
realize his advancement and the importance of good behavior.
He was grave and dignified, and about the fire in the evening,
played the violin with an air of skill and superiority that was
very impressive. Bosephus at first enjoyed it all immensely.
The bears were obedient and submissive, and were gradually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
learning to understand his language. He had more money than
he would ever need and was lord of all he surveyed.</p>

<p>But gradually there came a change. He grew tired of seeing
only the black faces and shining eyes of his subjects and of
hearing only the singing of bees and birds. At first he did not
realize what was the matter. Then it came to him at last that
this life of the forest was palling upon him and that, like the cub,
he yearned for his own kind&mdash;the faces of men.</p>

<p>One morning he divided up the money into two equal parts
and slipped out to where Horatio was sunning himself and playing
softly before the cabin.</p>

<p>"Horatio," he said, tenderly, "I have divided up the money.
Here is your half. You have been the best friend I ever had and
it breaks my heart to leave you, but I can't live away from my
own race any longer. I am going back to Louisiana, to the
planter who told me to come back and he would send me to
school and college and make a man of me," and then the little
boy suddenly broke down and fell weeping into his companion's
arms.</p>

<p>For some moments Horatio could not speak. Then he
spoke, sobbing between every word.</p>

<p>"Bo&mdash;Bo&mdash;you&mdash;you're&mdash;not&mdash;not going to&mdash;to leave
me! Oh, Bo!" and the poor Bear gave way completely and
wept on the little boy's shoulder. They were all alone, as the
others had gone out together for a walk. At last Horatio put
the boy gently from him and took up his violin. He began to
play very softly and sang in a breaking voice:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"Oh, he's going away to leave me to the Lou'siana shore,<br />
And I'll never see my darling, my Bosephus, any more;<br />
He's divided up the money, and he's going far away,<br />
And my poor old heart is breaking but he&mdash;will&mdash;not&mdash;stay.<br />
We have battled with the weather&mdash;we have faced the world together&mdash;<br />
Never caring why or whether&mdash;never minding when or where&mdash;<br />
But he says we now must sever&mdash;happy days are done forever,<br />
For Bosephus and the fiddle and the Old&mdash;Black&mdash;Bear!"<br /></div>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>An hour later Bo was wending his way southward through
the sweet spring woods alone. In his inner breast pocket was
stored every dollar the friends had earned together.</p>

<p>"I will never need it now, Bo," Horatio had said at parting,
"and you will need a great many times as much. Take it and
sometimes think of your far off faithful Ratio." And then,
after one long embrace, they had parted. And now the little
boy was trying to keep up courage to carry out what he had undertaken.
At every turn in the path he was tempted to return
and throw himself in Horatio's arms. But he pressed on, hoping
to arrive at some sort of habitation for the night, which he
did not like to pass alone in the woods.</p>

<p>"Poor old Ratio," he thought. "He will be happier with
his own people after a while. And perhaps he will really civilize
them." He turned and cast one long look in the direction of
the colony which he could no longer see. Then facing about
again he hurried forward. About a mile further on he paused
at a little brook for a drink. He was bending over the water
when he heard a sudden crashing in the bushes behind him. He
started up instantly and seized a heavy stick that lay close at
hand. Nearer and nearer came the tearing through the brush,
like some heavy animal in fierce chase. The boy stepped out
of the path to let the creature pass, and then, all at once, he
gave a cry of joy and surprise. Headlong out of the bushes,
stumbling and rolling at his feet, with tears streaming from his
eyes and violin under his arm, was Horatio.</p>

<p>"Bo, Bo!" he cried. "I couldn't stand it. I'm going with
you. That kind planter will give me a place to stay, I know, and
maybe if he sends you to college he'll let me go, too. I could
play for the college boys, Bo, and help pay your way. Don't
send me back, Bo! Don't send me back!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Bo embraced him silently.</p>

<p>"Why, of course not, Ratio," he said at last, "but I thought
you wanted to have a colony of your own people."</p>

<p>"I did, Bo, but I have turned it over to Cub. He can take
care of it. Like you, Bo, I have been civilized too long to live
away from men! And, besides, Bo, you need me to protect
you." Horatio recovered his dignity at this point and continued,
gravely, "You are brave and noble, Bosephus, but you
need some one near you who is ever ready to face any danger.
Let us sing now, Bosephus, as we travel onward."</p>

<p>And with a joyful scrape of the strings and a sweet burst
of melody the friends set their faces once more to the South.</p>
